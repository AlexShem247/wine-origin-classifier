87131,US,"Very good Dry Creek Zin, robust and dry and spicy. Really gets the tastebuds watering, with its tart flavors of sour cherry candy, red currants, blueberries, tart raisins and oodles of peppery spices. Drink this lusty wine with barbecue.",89,25,Zinfandel
57952,France,"A very herbaceous character makes this wine seem rather thin. It's soft and lightweight, and the lemon zest character is mildly attractive. Ready to drink.",84,20,Bordeaux-style White Blend
96046,US,"A little simple and easy, but there's a wealth of raspberry, strawberry and floral notes in this delicate wine. It's a bit too sweet for my tastes, although it does have good acidity.",84,19,Rosé
31920,US,"From a dry-farmed vineyard and treated to wild yeast and minimal new French oak, this Petite is chewy in leathery tannins, a definite crowd pleaser for Petite fans. Blackberries, coffee and pepper commingle impressively.",88,38,Petite Sirah
6091,US,"From a site near Annapolis, this wine shows a preponderance of dark grape and cherry flavor interwoven with cinnamon and black peppercorn. Light-bodied and ethereally layered, it has touches of rustic earthiness and leather.",91,62,Pinot Noir
101129,US,"A mix of Cabernet, Cab Franc and Syrah, this out-of-the-ordinary blend is a little funky and meaty, but still offers lots of juicy black fruit and a whole lot of toasted oak. If any one thing announces itself here it's the wood, which keeps everything austere and maybe a touch overcharred.",89,42,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
53584,Italy,"Taurasi is a wine that flaunts a determined and powerful personality, and Fatica Contadina is no exception, thanks to its deep layers of spice, dark fruit, tobacco and cigar that it delivers to the senses. On the palate, it is austere and tightly structured.",89,32,Aglianico
61538,US,"Sourced entirely from Walla Walla's Les Collines Vineyard, this lovely Syrah features pretty strawberry and cherry flavors that are broadly displayed with a rich vein of chocolate. It's forward and flavorful, drinking quite nicely already, but with the stuffing to cellar for a few more years.",90,40,Syrah
61984,US,"There's a lot to like about this Viognier. It's dry and zesty in acidity, with complex flavors of citrus, peach, kumquat, white pepper, chamomile and honey.",90,20,Viognier
16517,US,"A crisp, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc, fermented and aged in stainless steel. Shows rich, savory citrus and green grass flavors, with hints of minerals and flowers. Very drinkable and bone-dry.",90,21,Sauvignon Blanc
