35544,US,"From one of the Russian River's premier Sauvignon Blanc producers, although recent vintages have slipped in quality.

17364,US,"This late-disgorged wine has been released at the age of 11 years. It's a beautiful wine, notable especially for the ultrafine feeling of the mousse, or bubbles. So refined and silky.

74432,US,"Lots of zesty acidity in this Pinot Noir, giving the pomegranate, rhubarb, red cherry and licorice flavors a bright edge. The wine is very dry and complexly layered.

The Viognier is definitely present, and the wine has a top end of grapefruit and citrus, adding scent, flavor and acid. It's full, forward, acidic and a little hot, and delivers plenty of flavor up front.
