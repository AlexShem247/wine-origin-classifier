87131,"Very good Dry Creek Zin, robust and dry and spicy. Really gets the tastebuds watering, with its tart flavors of sour cherry candy, red currants, blueberries, tart raisins and oodles of peppery spices. Drink this lusty wine with barbecue.",25,89,Zinfandel,US,US,1
57952,"A very herbaceous character makes this wine seem rather thin. It's soft and lightweight, and the lemon zest character is mildly attractive. Ready to drink.",20,84,Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,France,1
96046,"A little simple and easy, but there's a wealth of raspberry, strawberry and floral notes in this delicate wine. It's a bit too sweet for my tastes, although it does have good acidity.",19,84,Rosé,US,France,0
31920,"From a dry-farmed vineyard and treated to wild yeast and minimal new French oak, this Petite is chewy in leathery tannins, a definite crowd pleaser for Petite fans. Blackberries, coffee and pepper commingle impressively.",38,88,Petite Sirah,US,US,1
6091,"From a site near Annapolis, this wine shows a preponderance of dark grape and cherry flavor interwoven with cinnamon and black peppercorn. Light-bodied and ethereally layered, it has touches of rustic earthiness and leather.",62,91,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
101129,"A mix of Cabernet, Cab Franc and Syrah, this out-of-the-ordinary blend is a little funky and meaty, but still offers lots of juicy black fruit and a whole lot of toasted oak. If any one thing announces itself here it's the wood, which keeps everything austere and maybe a touch overcharred.",42,89,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,US,1
53584,"Taurasi is a wine that flaunts a determined and powerful personality, and Fatica Contadina is no exception, thanks to its deep layers of spice, dark fruit, tobacco and cigar that it delivers to the senses. On the palate, it is austere and tightly structured.",32,89,Aglianico,Italy,Italy,1
61538,"Sourced entirely from Walla Walla's Les Collines Vineyard, this lovely Syrah features pretty strawberry and cherry flavors that are broadly displayed with a rich vein of chocolate. It's forward and flavorful, drinking quite nicely already, but with the stuffing to cellar for a few more years.",40,90,Syrah,US,US,1
61984,"There's a lot to like about this Viognier. It's dry and zesty in acidity, with complex flavors of citrus, peach, kumquat, white pepper, chamomile and honey.",20,90,Viognier,US,France,0
16517,"A crisp, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc, fermented and aged in stainless steel. Shows rich, savory citrus and green grass flavors, with hints of minerals and flowers. Very drinkable and bone-dry.",21,90,Sauvignon Blanc,US,France,0
24901,"This proprietary bottling from Shafer is always a huge wine. The 2010, which contains a splash of Petite Verdot, is gigantically packed with blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and sweet oak, courtesy of 20 months in 100% new French oak barrels. The wine is a bit of a bully now, but it has the balance to age. Give it until 2018.",72,92,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
62631,"Made with organically farmed fruit, this blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Colorino opens with an inky, dark color and savory aromas of ripe fruit, prune, plum, leather, tobacco and exotic spice. It's firm and well structured, with a velvety feel to the tannins.",35,89,Red Blend,Italy,Italy,1
2544,"Aromas of blue flower, black-skinned fruit and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub meld in the glass. The chewy, straightforward palate doles out juicy black cherry and ground pepper. It's made to drink young so enjoy soon.",22,89,Nero d'Avola,Italy,Italy,1
67123,"Bright, clean and linear with pretty accents of spice, blackberry, leather and lingering tobacco, Villa al Cortile Riserva is the kind of wine you'll want to pair with a hearty meat dinner. The wine shows velvety, soft texture in the mouth.",60,91,Sangiovese Grosso,Italy,Italy,1
28494,"Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, the grapes are single vineyard, Rattlesnake Hills AVA fruit. The best of the Girly Girl lineup, though the promising beginning (cassis and berry, scented with black olive and herb) quickly fades into a forest floor finale of decaying leaves.",19,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
34039,"The 2009 vintage blend is 41% Marsanne, 42% Grenache Blanc, 10% Picpoul and 7% Roussanne. Complex, rich and dense, it wraps its stone and tropical fruit flavors in layers of caramel, nougat, marshmallow and spice. Still quite young, with plenty of years of life ahead.",25,92,White Blend,US,France,0
52991,"A blend of Nero d'Avola, Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, Campobello's entry-level red is slightly muddled, but it does a good job of offering genuine fruit flavors and overall freshness.",17,86,Red Blend,Italy,Italy,1
4313,"This unusual wine displays notes of cigar box, strong green herbs and woodspice. It drinks on the lighter side of medium bodied with coffee and nori flavors and a smoke-filled finish.",22,82,Tempranillo,US,Spain,0
23629,"A bit rough in texture, but otherwise pretty flavorful, with vanilla, lime, strawberry and yeast flavors. It's a great sparkling wine for everyday.",30,87,Sparkling Blend,US,Spain,0
80022,"It's not a bad name for this vineyard—Charmes. This wine, which expresses the nature of the vineyard, is certainly approachable, friendly almost. But there's also a steel fist there that demands time. And if you can't wait, it's a great wine to drink now.",92,93,Chardonnay,France,France,1
40101,"Like a photocopy of a photocopy, this thinned-down Pinot Noir contains only a suggestion of the real thing. It's dry, but watery in cherry-cola flavors.",12,82,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
71780,"Spicy and dry, this Zin offers flavors of currants, tobacco, pepper and cocoa. The tannins are thick, but acidity is low, giving it a soft mouthfeel. Could be more concentrated, but it's an elegant wine.",36,87,Zinfandel,US,US,1
23503,"Fresh ripe raspberry aromas are cut with cranberry-skin tartness in this wine by Josh Baker and Matt Brain. They have also managed to sneak blood, pencil shavings, eucalyptus and vanilla stick into the nose of this appellation blend. It's lively and tasty with ripe, tart red fruits once sipped, juicy yet cut with chaparral scrub elements.",30,91,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
49705,"Here's a pleasant, fruity, rich Bordeaux blend that impresses for its sheer wealth of flavor. Floods the mouth with blackberries, cherries, red and black currants and sweet, smoky oak, with firm but finely ground tannins. Feels direct and simple now, but that could be a function of youth. Try holding for 4–6 years and see where it goes.",40,89,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,France,0
48057,"Powerful and intense without going over the top, this is a fine example of white Hermitage. The golden straw color gives a first indication of its richness, followed by scents of honey, even a hint of butterscotch. It's unctuous in the mouth, boasting flavors of grilled nuts and stone fruits, and finishing with just a touch of warmth.",50,92,Rhône-style White Blend,France,France,1
33607,"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward.",125,94,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,US,1
58284,"Dry as a bone, with bristling minerality, this is an elegant rosé that balances penetrating strawberry, cherry and plum flavors with sharp, lime-tinged acidity and a hint of wildflower. Drink now.",20,88,Rosé,US,France,0
73565,"One of the first 2008 Pinots to be released, this fresh young wine has Beaujolais Nouveau-like flavors of freshly crushed cherries, with tangy acidity. It's a fun wine to drink with a juicy cheeseburger.",16,85,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
36377,"A very good introduction to Steven Kent's Livermore Cabernets, sourced from a handful of his single-vineyard designates, including the Ghielmetti, Home Ranch and Smith Ranch. This is 79% Cab with smatterings of Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot (an up and coming varietal in Livermore), and still needs some time to develop but all the essentials are there.",35,89,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
9889,"Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon make a warm, blend that is full, herbal and concentrated with black fruits and dark tannins. Spice provides a reminder that this wine comes from a warm climate. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2016.",40,91,Red Blend,France,US,0
1230,"This opens with a pretty floral fragrance of acacia, Spanish broom and chamomile. The palate doles out white peach and tangerine zest alongside fresh acidity.",20,87,White Blend,Italy,France,0
39975,"Green vegetable aromas mingle with fresh kiwi and lime and a touch of pepper and salt. The wine is going through the sort of closed-up phase common with Chenin Blanc, the fruits just a hint, the texture smooth. Give it another 3–4 years, and the fruits will come together with mature almond flavors.",22,91,Chenin Blanc,France,France,1
28105,"Ripe orange, lime and honey flavors combine with tingly, mouth-watering acidity to give this dry Chardonnay a sweet-and-sour taste. It's an easy wine to drink with mushroom risotto, garlic shrimp, chicken fajitas.",20,87,Chardonnay,US,US,1
4911,"This delicate Pinot Noir provides plenty of drinking pleasure, but it's not without limitations. Chief among them is a hint of raw, dank mushroom. It's not strong, but just enough to weigh down the raspberries and cherries. Drink it by 2016.",45,87,Pinot Noir,US,France,0
40179,"The shade of this Kathy Joseph creation is that of rosé-colored sunglasses. Such comfort is furthered with a cherry cola and maraschino cherry nose. A slight effervescent zing on the palate accompanies pomegranate flavors followed by an impressively long finish. Great with a fresh garden salad, but able to handle more substantial fare too, such as  breaded chicken cutlets or a cheeseburger.",22,89,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
96018,"Overt and round, with chunky aromas of berries and stone fruits. Quite lively and zesty, with purity of flavors. Is it a touch limited in scope and complexity? Yes. But the nectarine and orange flavors are crystalline and the mouthfeel rocks. Imported by Vranken America.",130,90,Champagne Blend,France,France,1
35291,"A pale pink sparkler with loads of intensity and elegance, Essence opens with delicate aromas of cranberry, toasted almond, mature fruit and grapefruit. The wine's perlage is steady and foamy.",36,90,Sparkling Blend,Italy,France,0
42798,Nasty. Hits the mouth with astringent green flavors and turns harsher and more bitter on the finish.,24,80,Zinfandel,US,US,1
28809,"This wine's excellently layered yet light nose mixes pomelo skin with tangelo and lime-spritzed pink-apple notes. The palate is extremely nervy, with grippy lemon-skin texture and squeezed-citrus flavors, all balanced by riper apple. It's like biting into a cold, crisp, just-ripe pear or nectarine.",30,93,Grüner Veltliner,US,Italy,0
13915,Viognier does well in warm climates and this Sicilian expression of the French grape shows pretty floral nuances backed by white almond and orange blossom. Pair this wine with sea bass grilled in lemon leaves or fried squid.,18,86,Viognier,Italy,Italy,1
20355,"Yeasty, bready aromas of cantaloupe and citrus feed into an undefined palate that foams up on tongue. Citrus and melon flavors are bland, with powdered sugar and orange notes on the finish.",10,82,Bobal,Spain,Spain,1
9558,"Sourced from a vineyard planted by Gary Andrus in 1998, this elegant and expressive wine is shaded a lovely rose tone, and scents of rose petals and ripe cherries emerge instantly from the glass. It's well defined, balanced and detailed with sandalwood, cocoa powder, cinnamon and orange-liqueur highlights. Drink now through 2021.",45,93,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
1862,The classic blend for Figeac with its 32% of Cabernet Sauvignon and 28% Cabernet Franc gives a beautifully dense wine with great tannins. The wine is perfumed while the complex tannins are finely cushioned by the generous black fruits and acidity. It is a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2026.,90,97,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,France,1
81086,"This wine wears its 15.8% alcohol better than any similarly heady wine out there. Yes, it's a bit hot, but the heat comes across as a slight chili pepper edge to the blackberry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors, and the wine is, in its own way, balanced and elegant. Hard to imagine a more perfect barbecue red.",31,90,Primitivo,US,Italy,0
97304,"Like the regular Chardonnay, Beuna Vista's regular Pinot Noir is a medium-bodied, easy-drinking version of the variety. There's enough herbal complexity to keep it interesting, but the cherry-tinged fruit is ripe and the tannins supple. Finishes with a burst of crisp acidity.",22,87,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
85860,"Similar to Petite Sirah, this is a dark, full-bodied red wine with significant tannins. It's dry, with berry, currant and spice flavors, and kind of rustic. Calls to mind barbecue.",30,85,Teroldego,US,Italy,0
77282,"A quite green style of Champagne, very clean and very crisp. From one of the Champagne cooperatives, this is a great value wine, with pleasing freshness. Imported by Grape Expectations of Georgia.",38,86,Champagne Blend,France,France,1
83939,"At first this Chaleur Estate seemed closed up tight and lightly herbal, but grudgingly opened with streaks of olive, chalk, coffee grounds. A second bottle was much brighter, layered with plum, cherry, chocolate, herb, and an impression of pepper. Subtle and sleek, this wine is built to age and needs to be decanted.",75,93,Red Blend,US,US,1
67943,"An elegant Cabernet that's ready to drink tonight and will hold for some years. Shows good Napa character, with lush, ripe tannins and flavors of black currants, blackberries and cedar that cry out for a good steak.",30,88,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1

38028,"Light, fresh wine, showing pineapple and pear flavors, but in a delicate way. It has lift, crispness, a fine touch of citrus and a hint of toast. An attractive, easy white Burgundy. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",17,85,Chardonnay,France,France,1
36315,"Dark and deep, with cola, black fruit and truffle aromas. There's good lift to the palate, but overall it has to be classified as a dense, warm-climate wine with a big body and equally large flavors of black plum, olive and coffee. Seems short and a little simple on the finish.",40,87,Monastrell,Spain,Spain,1
77717,"Light and citrusy, this off-dry Riesling features pleasant floral and spice notes that just lack a little zip on the finish.",12,83,White Riesling,US,US,1
29438,"Stiff and tart, this young wine needs a few more years of cellaring to fill itself out. The balance is right, and the vineyard's full-bodied tannins are there in abundance.",28,88,Cabernet Franc,US,France,0
98849,"Thin and watery, with diluted citrus flavors and lots of raw acidity.",15,81,Fumé Blanc,US,France,0
14607,"A Côtes du Rhône-style blend meant to be drunk early and around a weekday meal, among Terre Rouge's easiest to drink and find wines. There's lots to like, from the wine's high-toned cherry and boysenberry aromas and flavors to its traces of black olive and jaunty, gamy pepper.",18,88,Rhône-style Red Blend,US,France,0
5438,"The simplest and fruitiest of the Cahors made at Gaudou, this is still a structured wine that has some firm, very young tannins that need to round out. Plenty of fruity, fresh black-currant flavor is cut by crisp acidity. The wine will need to age, so drink from 2016.",17,87,Malbec-Merlot,France,France,1
88997,"Burgundian technique was used in this wine, and the aromas and tastes of those techniques dominate. The wine is heavy in leesy, yeasty, toasted oak notes, which dominate, rather than subtlely support, the underlying fruit.",35,83,Chardonnay,US,France,0
34715,"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish. For under $15 this is good, casual Albariño that won't steer you wrong.",14,87,Albariño,Spain,Spain,1
51077,"Sourced from the Bacchus vineyard, this is an oaky, buttery Chardonnay that's fine for an every day quaffer. The oaky flavors quickly overtake fruit that is simple, clean, and apple flavored.",17,85,Chardonnay,US,US,1
3565,"Light and almost effervescent in the glass, this popular Grenache-based pink from Doug Margerum offers yeasty, Champagne-like aromas, soft lemon-peel scents and wet slate minerality. The palate's tingling acidity delivers chalky lime and cotton candy flavors, bound together with compelling tension.",21,91,Rosé,US,US,1
74729,"Made from equal amounts of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this wine was aged on the lees for more than four years, which gives it a fabulous creamy, yeasty complexity. There are tantalizing flavors of limes, orange zest, roasted hazelnuts, minerals and smoke. Absolutely wonderful now, and should hold and develop in the bottle through 2014, at least. Only 563 cases produced.",85,96,Sparkling Blend,US,France,0
63422,"Nice and dry, with lots of black pepper-infused wild blackberry flavors wrapped into big but pliant tannins. Lots of crunchy acidity, too, which makes the wine sharp. Will be great with a rich steak.",32,87,Syrah,US,US,1
25870,"A monstrous mix of Mourvèdre (89%) and Syrah (11%) from Calaveras's Dalton Vineyard, Twisted Oak's River of Skulls opens with a heady nose of bright cherry, black tea and candied dark plum and shows off bright acidity for such a pleasantly plump wine. Tannins are resolved and yet rightfully there. The long finish is enveloped in raspberry flavors.",35,88,Rhône-style Red Blend,US,US,1
67112,"Here's a bright, buoyant style of Brunello that drinks easily but also delivers the sophistication and complexity you should expect of Montalcino. It opens with crisp, tonic aromas of cassis and wild berry with very subtle aromas of vanilla and toasted nut at the back.",55,91,Sangiovese Grosso,Italy,Italy,1

18786,"Ever since Tamber Bey made the switch from Oakville fruit to their vineyard in Yountville, their Cabernets have dropped in quality. This '09 is dry, tannic and uninteresting, with a harshness that makes it difficult to appreciate the blackberry and cherry fruit.",42,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
40259,"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.",15,82,Tempranillo,Spain,Spain,1
98965,"Comes on a bit flat, with a streak of cardboard under the fruit. Not as fresh as it should be, given the vintage.",14,81,Riesling,US,US,1
37020,"We suggest very little time with this bulky, medicinal Tempranillo. Despite color and weight, it's prickly, sour and not too ripe. The flavors and finish are short, while the overriding impression is that it's underdeveloped.",11,82,Tempranillo,Spain,Spain,1
34925,There are brambly notes here of forest floor and underbrush backed by enough fresh fruit to keep the wine chewy and fresh in the mouth. You'll also get notes of wet tobacco and wild mushroom that add complexity.,22,87,Barbera,Italy,Italy,1
85609,"With a modern winery located at the foot of the picturesque town of Barolo, Cascina Adelaide proudly produces a bold and innovative interpretation of Barolo. This is a powerful and generous wine with big spice, berry, smoke and mineral tones. The cards it plays best, however, are intensity and persistency.",88,93,Nebbiolo,Italy,Italy,1
93975,"Here's a Prosecco from the Cartizze cru (offered by the excellent Bortolin estate) that boasts mineral notes and talc powder followed by plush, creamy peach and yellow fruit. The wine ends with a very feminine note of fresh flowers.",30,88,Glera,Italy,Italy,1
35900,"With its rounded texture and smooth wood and yellow fruits, this is a generous wine. It has weight and some richness tempered with acidity and a prominent apple skin character. In another few months, the wine's richness will show better.",45,89,Chardonnay,France,US,0
30219,"For an $18 Oregon Pinot, you can't do much better than this well-made wine from a top-flight vintage. Brambly black cherry fruit carries a streak of cola, with ripe, moderate tannins balancing out a medium-long finish.",18,89,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
821,"It opens with aromas of forest floor, porcini mushroom and espresso. The straightforward palate offers bright berry, coffee and grilled herbs alongside firm tannins. Drink 2015–2020.",28,88,Nebbiolo,Italy,Italy,1
93271,"Atypically dark in color, this brassy Châteauneuf blanc comes across as aromatically muted. Then it's very neutral in flavor, with ample breadth but lacking in richness and depth. It's something of a conundrum.",48,85,Rhône-style White Blend,France,France,1
82383,"Feels soft and cloyingly sweet in pineapple jam and buttered popcorn flavors, and is beginning to be tired and old. Drink up.",34,82,Chardonnay,US,US,1
32339,"Full and round, with snappy acidity that brings life and lift to the luscious fruit, this delicious wine is aimed at those who like a festival of green and yellow fruits in their glass. It has fine texture and length, with a defining mineral streak that elevates this well beyond just fruity. It has medium-term aging potential as well.",22,91,Chardonnay,US,France,0
54283,"This is an ultrarich, ripe Cabernet, marked by jammy blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit flavors, with a milk chocolate sweetness and soft, intricate tannins. Made in the soft, modern style, it's best over the next six years.",50,90,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
43946,"A bit rugged and hot in the mouth. Offers a good array of plummy cherry flavor, with bright, zingy acidity and a touch of smoky oak.",16,84,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
49251,"From the steep Sonoma slopes of Mount St. Helena comes this tannic, concentrated young 100% Cabernet. Dramatic in structure and flavor, with massively packed blackberries, dark chocolate and pain grillé. The wine was aged in 49% new oak, which adds smoky, spice overtones. Drink now and through 2013.",40,93,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
9209,"Lightly fruity and fresh, a wine that has some crisp acidity although without much definition. The aftertaste is clean, bringing out attractive citrus and red currant fruits. Screwcap.",12,84,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,US,0
35544,"From one of the Russian River's premier Sauvignon Blanc producers, although recent vintages have slipped in quality. The '09 is a good wine, dry and crisp, with citrus, gooseberry and spice flavors. But it's missing the richness of earlier vintages.",35,87,Sauvignon Blanc,US,US,1
30909,"Apple and nectarine aromas are clean and snappy, with a hint of yeast-based vanilla. A fresh, citric palate delivers lime, green apple, pineapple and nectarine flavors, while the finish is clean as a new razor, with nothing off, bitter or pithy.",14,88,Verdejo,Spain,Spain,1
6152,"Dull and dusty on the nose, this burly Zin opens up in the glass, offering a slight sweetness of blackberry and vanilla amid its soft texture and structure.",22,86,Zinfandel,US,US,1
50031,"Classic Lodi Cab, from a vintage that wasn't too hot or too cool. The wine is soft and lush, with milk chocolate and cassis flavors and the vanillins and sweet char of oak. Easy and delicious, it's a wine to drink now.",59,88,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
17364,"This late-disgorged wine has been released at the age of 11 years. It's a beautiful wine, notable especially for the ultrafine feeling of the mousse, or bubbles. So refined and silky. Rich too are the flavors, in limes, strawberries, toasty lees and minerals. A spectacular sparkling wine that has many years of development ahead.",50,95,Sparkling Blend,US,France,0
74432,"Lots of zesty acidity in this Pinot Noir, giving the pomegranate, rhubarb, red cherry and licorice flavors a bright edge. The wine is very dry and complexly layered. Interesting now, if a bit primary in fruit, and balanced enough to develop additional nuances over the next six years.",56,92,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
16884,"Butterscotch and pineapple and peach jam flavors mark this Chardonnay. Fortunately, it's balanced with crisp acidity and a certain minerality. It's an obvious crowd pleaser, and would score higher except for the seemingly sweet finish.",15,85,Chardonnay,US,US,1
43557,"Fresh berries, young spice and raw notes of blueberry and raspberry color this bright blend of Montepulciano and Sangiovese from Central Italy. The wine is sharp and immediate in terms of the delivery of its easy tannins and bright, acidic finish.",10,86,Red Blend,Italy,Italy,1
91586,"Made from Tempranillo, this is a really pleasant rosé that shows a balance rare in California. Totally dry, crisp and relatively low in alcohol, the wine manages to be long and deep in creamy, spicy cherry, raspberry and vanilla bean flavors. Great job.",10,87,Tempranillo,US,Spain,0
62250,"Pungent of baked plum and baking spice, this Shenandoah Barbera is soft and rustic, yet refined, with a jolt of mocha espresso on the finish. The expert acidity enveloping this wine should pair with Mediterrean-themed food.",25,88,Barbera,US,Italy,0
8235,"Big, bold and concentrated, this full-bodied wine was given the complete new-barrel, lees-stirring treatment. It has a deep gold color, with ripe pear and buttered toast aromas that transition to waves of pear and apple on the palate and lingering finish.",20,91,Chardonnay,US,US,1
89202,"If you like 'em big and oaky, then this one's for you. Aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, roasted red apples, buttery toast and rich nuttiness all generously abound. The mouth is full and slightly fat, with moderate acidity and a medium-length, smoky finish.",25,85,Chardonnay,US,US,1
36063,"A mix of vineyards and AVAs go into this blended Syrah, which is co-fermented with 6% Viognier. The Viognier is definitely present, and the wine has a top end of grapefruit and citrus, adding scent, flavor and acid. It's full, forward, acidic and a little hot, and delivers plenty of flavor up front. What's not quite there is the layering of flavors that some of the other Walter Dacon Syrahs express.",30,88,Syrah,US,US,1

41278,"This new Malbec is a soft, fruity, extremely dark wine, with scents of raisins and pretty fruit flavors of boysenberries and black cherries, with lighter streaks of coffee and caramel woven through.

75448,"This is the winery's flagship red; in this vintage it's 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 14% Syrah. Sturdy and structured to age, the Syrah component pops in the pepper and spice, while the Cab and Merlot give it muscle and verve. Youthful, lovely floral notes and pure, pretty berry fruits shine in this ripe but graceful wine with sweet fruit, a pleasing midpalate and a clean and textural finish.",42,92,Red Blend,US,US,1

26424,"For the price, you get a Cabernet that shows some pretty good Napa character. It's ripe and forward with black currants with tough tannins and a hit of sweet oak. Lots going on, and could even age for a few years. If you drink it now, give it a couple hours of airing.",22,90,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
26735,"A food-friendly blend of Sangiovese, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc that shows easy but rich and intense fruit flavors of cherry and blackberry, plus a subtle spice note.",20,88,Red Blend,Italy,Italy,1
32321,"This is a firm and stony wine, with dry tannins that give structure to the intense acidity and the red cherry flavor. It's dense and concentrated, with a solid feel that demands several years of aging.",28,91,Gamay,France,France,1
73311,"Candied fruit and punch bowl aromas are not what you'd call sophisticated, and the mouth pretty much follows suit with tart, rubbery raspberry fruit that comes on a bit hot and raw. Tough but with full flavor; sort of like chewing on a plum skin.",12,84,Mencía,Spain,Spain,1
2694,"Aromas of black cherry, licorice, leather, violet and a whiff of tobacco open this wine. The palate is still a bit closed but delivers black raspberry, wild cherry, anisette and a note of black pepper alongside big, brooding tannins that need time to come around. Drink 2017–2024.",51,90,Nebbiolo,Italy,Italy,1
54930,"Fresh, full bodied and juicy, this has flavors of dusty, dark plum and chocolate. It was aged in both French and American oak, which has added a background note of tobacco and vanilla on the palate, particularly on the finish.",24,87,Petite Sirah,US,US,1
62971,"Il Puro is a simple but genuine expression of Merlot with soft cherry nuances backed by light shadings of spice and mineral. The texture is smooth and silky, and although this is a very simple wine, it does deliver easy drinking pleasure.",12,85,Merlot,Italy,Italy,1

17583,"Notable for its firm minerality and acidity and distinguished mouthfeel. Could be a little richer, but offers intricate raspberry, sour cherry candy, blueberry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Might blossom over the next few years. Drink now–2013.",58,92,Pinot Noir,US,France,0
33833,"As with its Momtazi vineyard bottling, Boedecker Cellars produced just two barrels of this Cherry Grove designate. It's a fragrant and focused effort, scented with rose petals and cherry candy, and carrying a spicy cinnamon streak into a textural, cola-laced finish.",50,90,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
3112,"Given the diverse clonal make-up of the vines that go in to this Pinot, the aromas are somewhat muted and shy. Earthy, spicy fruit flavors are characterized by baked red raspberry and strawberry notes, with the wine taking on a denseness on the palate and finish.",43,85,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
29953,"This pleasing blend yields a spicy, fruity wine with sweet strawberry and cherry candy flavors. Though two thirds new oak was used, it is not prominent. Smooth and accessible, this delicious wine is accented with aromas of sweet straw.",29,90,Red Blend,US,US,1
103591,"As much as we like the retro package, this time the contents are just too one-dimensional. The heavily toasted oak over the narrow fruit from the '98 vintage reads as just that—toast, with vanilla and coconut shadings. Dry powdery tannins mark the taut finish.",26,83,Sangiovese,Italy,Italy,1
71118,"This youthful expression of Dolcetto offers a dark, concentrated style and a very noticeable mineral tone that slices through the lush blueberry and raspberry aromas. The wine is tonic and vibrant and although there isn't huge complexity here, there is a good, fresh quality of fruit.",15,87,Dolcetto,Italy,Italy,1
37091,"It's incredibly rich and ripe in blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate, with a lovely veneer of toasted oak. The tannins are super smooth. Drink now–2020.",70,93,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
48301,"Blueberry fruit mingles with cinnamon-tinged oak spice on the nose and palate of this offering. There's even enough depth and complexity to make it more than a simple quaff, worthy of washing down simply roasted chicken perhaps.",18,86,Rhône-style Red Blend,France,France,1
103769,"Starts out nice, with a good, fruity raspberry nose, but on the palate are tastes of tomatoes, with a dry, astringent, tannic finish.",20,83,Zinfandel,US,US,1
16280,"A lovely and complex Cabernet from this mountain in the southerly Mayacamas chain. It shows the big, firm tannins of its origins, with a dry sturdiness backing up the intense black currant flavors. Drinkable now for sheer decadence, although it also seems to have the stuffing to age for a decade.",70,92,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1

4451,"Fermented and aged in stainless steel without going through malolactic fermentation, this steely, waxy Albarino is ready for tapas, offering big bold tastes of peach and apricot.

37017,"It's a rustic, slightly raisiny Bordeaux blend (with a little Syrah also), sourced from excellent vineyards, but a bit overripe. Soft, forward and a little leathery, it's ready to drink up.",16,85,Red Blend,US,France,0
1956,"Wood aging adds a smoky character and toasty flavor, while also smoothing out the tannins. From the rich 2009 vintage, this wine shows both plum fruits and firm tannins. It could still age, drink until 2018.",42,90,Gamay,France,France,1
94761,"Made from 60-year-old vines, evidenced by its concentration and serious ageability. It is structured, firm and relatively dry at this young stage. It's a wine that needs at least 5 years. Today, if you do open a bottle, watch for the mineral, stony character that pushes the fruit and demands attention.",85,93,Chardonnay,France,France,1
82293,"Made in the modern style, this Chardonnay is very ripe and rich in jammy pineapples, green apples and limes, enhanced with smoky, caramelized oak and a creamy, slightly sour note of lees. It's fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. Best now and through 2012 before the fruit goes south.",40,88,Chardonnay,US,US,1
21041,"With cassis and plum aromas, this mid-weight Cabernet Sauvignon from the Foothills has a taste of licorice and vanilla, particularly on the finish, testament to its 33 months in new American oak.",28,86,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
84421,"A wine that is soft, rounded, ready to drink. It is without concentration or great acidity, but the white and light green fruits are delicious, giving an open character that is framed by toasty flavors and some spice.",80,88,Chardonnay,France,France,1
20499,"Peppery and bright in acidity, this blend of half Grenache and lesser percentages of Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise is a bit mixed. On the one hand it offers red raspberry and pomegranate and perfumed aromatics; on the other hand, the earthiness detracts.",30,86,Rhône-style Red Blend,US,France,0
9274,"Just about every Dyer Cabernet requires aging. The 2009 bottling is tough with tannins, despite intense blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. The winemaker held it back from release even longer than the 2010, but it's still juvenile, with unintegrated oak, fruit and mineral notes. The window of drinkability is 2015–2025.",75,92,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1

88923,"Very tannic, rough.",11,80,Cabernet Merlot,US,France,0
88796,"This is a light and easy Prosecco Extra Dry with notes that recall cut grass and hay. There's not much in the way of flower or fruit aromas, although there is a hint of ripe banana and cardboard. It's tonic and lean with crisp freshness on the close.",15,84,Prosecco,Italy,Italy,1
34140,"At the age of six-plus years, this Cab still is dominated by the 100% new French oak in which it was aged. The fruit flavor, too, is young and primary, offering sweetly ripe cherries and blackberries. Even the tannins are fresh. The suggestion is continued cellaring, and the statistics concerning alcohol, acidity and pH suggest ideal balance. Hold for at least a year and try again.",85,92,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
1574,"Exotic and complex, this medium-bodied, structured wine is awash with aromas, from charcuterie and mixed nut to cedar and pencil. Anchoring it is a dusty tannic profile and a punch of oak.",90,92,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,France,0

48726,"As sweet as Port, with chocolate and prune flavors. Feels as hot as a chile pepper, with nearly 17% alcohol.",50,81,Zinfandel,US,US,1
36433,"This is a devastatingly good Bordeaux blend from Howell Mountain. Based on Cabernet, it has all the flavor you could ask for in blackberries, cherries, cassis, chocolate, herbs, spices and sweetly smoked oak. But the structure is awesome. Near perfect tannins, soft and intricately firm, and grand acidity make for a total Cabernet experience. Tremendous now, and should age for years.",120,97,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,US,1
79770,"What a roll St. Jean has been on with Chardonnay. This wine was made from a majority of Robert Young and Belle Terre vineyard fruit, and is two-thirds new French oak. The combination is mind-blowing. The vineyards contribute concentrated spicy, tropical fruit flavors and perfect acid balance, while the oak provides elaborate seasoning. Absolutely delicious. One of the most satisfying Chards of the vintage.",45,96,Chardonnay,US,US,1
76049,"This is a pure Cab Franc, stylish and varietal. The new oak was limited to just 30%, giving a kick to the natural toastiness of the grape. The fruit mixes blueberries, black cherry and a streak of cassis, then runs into luscious mocha and espresso, with highlights of black pepper and cedar. The tannins have been beautifully managed.",32,90,Cabernet Franc,US,France,0
40586,"The 79% Syrah component is estate-grown; while the 21% Grenache comes from the Lonesome Springs vineyard. What a lovely nose, with the bright and grapey Grenache shining through and adding pretty floral scents, while the Syrah fills in the berries and peppery tannins. This is still quite purple and youthful, fresh and just a bit volatile.",28,88,Syrah,US,US,1
43569,"This is a challenging Zin. It's fruity but it's also earthy and mushroomy, with a blast of vanilla oak. Right now it's pretty tannic, but beneath that roughness is a core of fruit. It's austere now—difficult even—but some time in the cellar could soften and open it.",35,86,Zinfandel,US,US,1
87288,"Smooth and dry, with appealing flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar, and a fine, spicy finish. Shows amazing style and elegance for the price. A real sommelier's bargain, with 2,853 cases produced.",10,88,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
43975,"This is a nice, traditionally styled Rioja. Delivers smooth, earthy, leathery aromas and then spicy dry fruit that's right out of Rioja 101. With good acidity, it's a very respectable table wine from a weak vintage.",28,87,Tempranillo,Spain,Spain,1
20154,"Bold and full bodied, this offers aromas of steeped plum, prune, clove and blue flower. The concentrated, savory palate doles out mature blackberry, raisin, clove and licorice. Big but velvety tannins and just enough freshness give this a surprisingly drinkable quality that belies its heft.",30,90,Primitivo,Italy,Italy,1
101572,"Smells very earthy and funky, with a strong hit of green pepper. More bell pepper and some cracked black pepper appear on the palate, which features some currant, licorice and lots of oak. Bright acidity helps it along, but it just can't escape its vegetal core, which holds it back.",30,86,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,France,0
56066,"Extraordinarily rich and ripe, showing sweet raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, enhanced with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak barrels. Brilliant acidity and wonderfully soft tannins make this Pinot instantly drinkable, yet it should age over the next 6–8 years.",70,94,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
53923,"Chris Dowsett makes just a single Gewürztraminer each year, always from Celilo vines planted in 1982. 2010 was the coolest vintage in two decades at this high-altitude site. If you love searing acidity, married to varietal spice, rose petals, lemons, grapefruit, star fruit and gooseberries, you are in for a treat. Fermented in neutral French oak and left on the lees, this could age for decades.",22,91,Gewürztraminer,US,US,1
29167,"This wine's judiciously restrained nose shows black fruits and dried herbs, with asphalt and focused rather than exuberant fig and plum aromas. There is lots of minty lift at the tip of the palate, which opens toward Mission figs, fudge and mocha.",30,93,Zinfandel,US,US,1

5671,"This wine from one of Anderson Valley's pioneers has a lighter-than-usual color and plenty of red cherry, raspberry and turned earth aromas. It offers low-level fruit flavors and good balance of acidity versus ripeness.",25,87,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
28267,"This red Passito dessert wine from Tuscany offers bittersweet aromas of wild cherry, raspberry, cassis and cola. It makes a simple but clean impression in the mouth and would pair with chocolate brownies or cherry pie.",32,86,Red Blend,Italy,Italy,1
86996,"Deeply flavored and impressive, this intensely young, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from Mount Veeder. It has all the hallmarks of a wine that needs time in the cellar. The sweetly extracted black currant and licorice fruit is massive, and so is the cedary oak, which is 80% new French, while considerable mountain tannins give a hard, astringent mouthfeel. Solidly in the modern Napa style, this opulent wine should improve over the next six years, at least.",56,94,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,US,1
51635,"This wine boasts an oak-driven character, with aromas of espresso, coffee and toasted almond. The palate shows red and black fruit layered with accents of oak, chocolate and black pepper. Technically well made, it's shy on personality and length.",27,86,Red Blend,Italy,US,0
61436,"A little too soft in both acidity and tannins to have perfect structure, but it's fine enough, and the flavors certainly are complex and compelling. They range from blackberry tart and cherry pie through Dr. Pepper cola and anise liqueur to bacon and sandalwood. If that sounds good, it is. Ready now.",39,90,Red Blend,US,US,1
10268,"This is a well-balanced wine that is both crisp and breezy and full of delicious red-berry fruits. It has a tight texture, with some minerality and a tangy aftertaste. This should make for an excellent apéritif.",15,90,Rosé,France,France,1

1430,"An evenly dispersed nose of sage bark, cherry compote and lightly toasted cedar introduces this bottling by Fred Brander, a Santa Ynez Valley winemaking pioneer now actively trying to create a new Los Olivos District appellation. The flavors are balanced between cherry fruit and oak, with smooth tannins throughout.",50,91,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1

33213,"This 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Syrah from coastal Tuscany opens with bright fruit, a somewhat lean texture and delivers lively berry notes of wild strawberry and white cherry. A good value, the wine would pair well with pizza or pasta.",10,84,Red Blend,Italy,Italy,1
11965,"Consistent with the rather lean house style this opens with herbal aromas set against firm, varietal cassis and blue plum fruit. The grapes come from a block planted in 1985. Some barrel spice adds cinnamon to the nose, and there's a touch of Cab Franc (6%) in the blend, which stiffens up the tannins. Retasting this wine after it has spent a few extra months in bottle, it's smoothed out a bit, and the sweet black- cherry fruit has moved forward. This should age really well.",28,89,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
69146,"The 2007 vintage was a fabulous one for Williams Selyem, and the Zinfandels benefited from the cool, balanced growing season. The Papera is a big, rich, jammy wine, but also a drily elegant one. It offers waves of raspberry, Fig Newton, red currant and Canadian bacon flavors, with superfine tannins. An exuberant Zinfandel now and for the next six years.",48,94,Zinfandel,US,US,1
25969,"Complicated, at times confusingly dank aromas of mushrooms, hops, dill and other wet herbs emerge from this bottling. Those atypical varietal characters find their way onto the palate as well, with olive and stewed mushrooms leading the way.",50,84,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
28997,"Still way too young, this is developing into a substantial and structured wine. Full of both fruit and tannins, it is dark and dense, very dry at this stage but with the most enticing perfumes. The Grand Cru, split between Chambolle-Musigny and Morey Saint-Denis, is known for its structure and this wine is a great example. Drink from 2020.",463,93,Pinot Noir,France,France,1
52507,"This is a great Napa Valley Merlot, from a winery with a generally good track record with the variety. The grapes were grown in the Coombsville region, although they were allowed to get very ripe, resulting in fairly high alcohol and rich cherry, berry, dark chocolate and anise flavors. It's notable for grippy tannins that give it a firm, dry mouthfeel.",42,92,Merlot,US,US,1

9991,"Though not planted until 2001, the east-facing Lone Oak Vineyard is adjacent to the legendary vines of Garys' and Rosella's.

Bright acidity exhilarates the tongue, making a perfect partner for a lunch of shellfish, halibut or chicken salad.",45,90,Chardonnay,US,US,1
54665,"A gorgeously salmon-colored rosé made predominantly from Grenache (62%) co-fermented dry with Viognier (58%) out of Yolo County. The wine has a delicately pretty nose of peach and a light-medium body despite its 14.8% alcohol, though the finish falls off fast.",18,86,Rosé,US,US,1
24824,"The most impressive of the fine range of wines from this producer, the wine is structured and dense without ever losing sight of balance, fruit and acidity. That makes for a wine that has a dusty texture coupled with a dry center of fruit and wood tannins. The acidity and the juicy berry fruits give freshness. Everything is ready for long aging. Drink from 2019.",60,95,Malbec,France,France,1
38757,"Searing acidity marks this wine, which tastes like it has a lot of Edna Valley fruit in the blend. It also shows bright, strong, long hangtime flavors of limes and pineapples. It's actually quite a fine Chardonnay, dry and low in alcohol. A great value at this price.",15,89,Chardonnay,US,US,1
67070,"This elegant effort is 46% Cab Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 18% Cab Franc; still wrapped up tight and showing tart cassis and berry fruit. There is a lot of the classic Ciel minerality underlying the fruit, with hard tannins and lightly peppery herbal details. At just 14.1% alcohol, this is a classic example of how Washington brings bright New World fruit and terroir to a style that retains the elegance of the Old World.",40,91,Red Blend,US,US,1
76194,"Pretty notes of Italian espresso, chocolate and spice revolve around a core of solid black fruit.

Drink after 2014.",90,93,Sangiovese Grosso,Italy,Italy,1

67447,"Bold and striking aromas of mushroom, seaweed and organic funk set this apart from the other Ken Wright vineyard designates. There's plenty of tart, tangy cherry fruit also, though it seems to hit a wall, perhaps due to the recent bottling. This is a wine that could score even higher with additional bottle age.",50,91,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
66870,"This is ripe and pungent, a rich and fruit-driven mix of fig, peach and melon. There are interesting herbal highlights, and more acidity than in the past.

69844,"Firm and compact, it mixes wild berry, plum and cassis fruits, giving this Cab-dominated blend the sleek appeal of a good St. Emilion, but without the aggressive herbaceousness. There is no obvious new oak here, but lovely suggestions of barrel that never override the superb fruit.",50,90,Red Blend,US,France,0
8586,"No, that's not a typo. The ??? Vineyard bottling conceals (intentionally) the fruit sources for these grapes, which come from one of Oregon's most expensive and highly-reviewed producers. It's crystal-clear in both appearance and flavor, building upon a cranberry/raspberry base into a potent young wine with expressive purity. A streak of gun metal, often found in consulting winemaker Robert Brittan's own wines, adds a stylish note to the finish.",55,94,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
69630,"Some wines have a personality that makes you want to smile. This is one of them. A big, rich, friendly wine full of fruit that was approachable and easy to drink.

29706,"This is a syrupy, rich, meaty wine that opens with impressive intensity and extraction. It's a bruiser and a pleaser that delivers aromas of cherry liqueur, blackberry jam and exotic spice. It's also a masculine, opulent wine that could use a few more years of cellar aging.",50,91,Sangiovese Grosso,Italy,Italy,1

A hint of mint, a splash of jasmine tea, and an engaging, long, refreshing finish all add to the pleasure.",20,93,Riesling,US,US,1
27271,"The best of the new releases from Michael Florentino, which has changed hands since this vintage was harvested. Autumnal flavors marry vivid, distinctive fruit to hints of leaf and citrus, elegant and complex.",25,91,Mourvèdre,US,Spain,0
45208,"It's nice that they've held back this wine for a few years before releasing it, because it's beginning to meld together in a very delightful way. The tannins, oak and alcohol are coalescing with the cherries, pomegranates, cola, tangerine, vanilla and spices, giving the wine a silky, complex, mellow mouthfeel. Beautifully dry and lush now, and should develop through 2012.",45,93,Pinot Noir,US,France,0
13579,"Give this tough, young Cabernet a good long decant before serving. At first, it's dominated by sharp acidity and mouth-numbing tannins. But after some airing, it offers black currant flavors. This is likely not an ager.",50,86,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
35452,"An intriguing wine, that offers ripe sweetness followed by an edgy rustic acidity. Is this a stage in its evolution? Probably, because the tannins promise aging and the intensely aromatic nature of the fruit points to a potentially fine wine. Just don't drink it yet.",55,89,Pinot Noir,France,France,1

100910,"Cherry, citrus rind and oak make for a short, stout nose. It seems more precise on the palate, with pure cherry and coffee flavors poking through a veil of tight tannins. Gets even firmer on the finish, with a smack of raisin. A wine that requires airing; or more cellar time.",30,88,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Italy,France,0
92262,"Smooth and ripe, this Bordeaux blend pleases for its rich array of blackberry, cherry and spicy plum flavors. The texture is soft and chocolaty. Loses a point or two for the sugary finish, though. Drink now.",40,85,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,France,0
34491,"2008 was a great vintage for Tax, and this Santa Barbara bottling is a great value. It really delivers, offering a dry, elegantly structured and complex wine. The silky texture houses savory flavors of cherries, red currants, cola and sandalwood, with an umami taste of bacon. Just delicious for drinking now.",23,91,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
87474,"Bone dry with aromas of freshly pressed apples, this is an austere but elegant sparkling blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.

40885,"Von Strasser has a good track record with this wine, and the '05 is right up there with the best, but be forewarned. It's very tannic. But then, it is from Diamond Mountain. Give it a good 4 years, at least, to throw some sediment and let the rich blackberry and black currant flavors emerge. Should hold well for 15 years.",75,92,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
27496,"Fans of the ripe, modern style of Chardonnay will fall in love with this bottling. It's strong in toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream and peach, pear and pineapple jam flavors that dazzle and wow the palate. Easy to find, with nearly 17,000 cases produced.",22,87,Chardonnay,US,US,1

98926,"A Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the grapes for this stunning wine came from David Abreu's vineyard in the St. Helena foothills. It's very complex, softer, more open and approachable than Colgin's 100% Cabs, with a flamboyant spectrum of cherries,  framboise, cocoa, violets, gingerbread and spices framed in supple, fine tannins. Beautiful, a feminine wine of great beauty. Drink now through 2015.",225,95,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,US,1
64710,"Here's a pale and luminous rosé from Southern Italy with a pinkish-peach color and delicate aromas of stone fruit, wild berries, white cherries and a touch of chopped mint or basil. The wine is tart but also slightly sweet in the mouth and there's a touch of bitter almond on the close.",15,85,Rosé,Italy,Italy,1
80079,"Full, roasted and earthy on the nose, with only some coconut and berry aromas to sweeten things up. Tight, level and structured in the mouth, with roasted raspberry and plum along with oaky, buttery, smoky accents that confirm the wine's “roble” designation. Good but with some excess oak to process.",18,86,Tempranillo,Spain,Spain,1
52811,"Here's an absolutely terrific, but informal sparkling rosé from southern Italy (made with Negroamaro grapes). Sweet berry, chopped mint and peach come to the fore and the wine is soft and slightly sweet. It's easy, fresh and would make a great cocktail choice.",10,86,Negroamaro,Italy,Italy,1
77955,"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.",26,89,Tempranillo,Spain,Spain,1
37665,"Although this is Ste. Michelle's widely available Merlot offering, it breaks the mold by being held back a considerable time prior to release. It's an unusual wine, with scents of overripe, raisined fruit, a streak of tobacco and black licorice, a soft midpalate, and some bitterness in the finishing tannins.",16,84,Merlot,US,US,1

77595,"Amador Foothill does a good job with Sangiovese, and this dry rosé is made from that variety. It's a cheerful wine, brisk in acidity and with delicate but complex cherry, rose petal and lavender flavors. The winemaker recommends bouillabaisse, which is a pretty good suggestion.",11,86,Sangiovese,US,Italy,0
57160,"Veneered with oak, the nose bears strong aromas of carpenter's shop and charred sugar, with notes of dark stone fruit and cranberry sauce lingering beneath.

47874,"Dark as night, and dominated by meaty plum and beef jerky aromas. The palate is huge, with pure fruit, tannin and chocolate pooling at the finish.

It's incredibly spicy, offering everything from black and white pepper to nutmeg, anise and clove. The texture is a delight—silky and gently tannic. While the official alcohol is 13.7%, it tastes warmer.",24,90,Zinfandel,US,US,1

100226,"Spice and blackcurrant aromas are combined with solid tannins and powerful wood flavors to give a spectacular, polished style, a contrast to the  often rustic wines that come from this appellation.

It's strong in primary fruit, showcasing blackberries, black cherries, plums, carob and cola, and also strong in tannins, with a brisk, scoury mouthfeel.

Like any great young Petite Sirah, it will age for many years.",25,93,Petite Sirah,US,US,1

In the mouth, it's an intense ride of rich black cherry and plum. For now it's a little closed on the finish; will likely be better in three years.",49,89,Tempranillo,Spain,Spain,1
12825,"A little sweet, which makes the wine less subtle, this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend has jammy raspberry, cherry and vanilla smoke flavors. The finish is very sweet.",40,85,Sparkling Blend,US,US,1
81567,"Very few wineries got Walla Walla grapes in this freeze year, and even L'Ecole, which owns a piece of the Seven Hills vineyard, had to rely on other sources for many of its wines. But this is 100% Seven Hills Syrah, and it delivers wonderful fruit flavors with layers of citrus and tart berries. A green tea streak cuts through the substantial tannins.",37,89,Syrah,US,US,1
29449,"Soft and dense with dark fruit, almost baked fruit flavors, that veer into nuts and vanilla, an easy-drinking Zin blended with a smidge of Zin from the 2009 and 2010 vintages as well as 7% Petite Sirah crafted by a Lodi producer to watch.",24,88,Zinfandel,US,US,1
67032,"Mainly Syrah, with a splash of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Viognier, this polished wine is marked by things that are red: red cherries, red currants and red licorice. It's dry, full bodied and tannic. When you swallow, astrigency remains behind, with the aftertaste of crushed red pepper. Lovely and complex, it's a wine to decant.",35,92,Rhône-style Red Blend,US,France,0
13073,"The bouquet is marked by a steady stream of bright raspberry, rose, wild berry and bitter almond. It's sassy crispness on the finish should pair well with cheese or mayonnaise-based appetizers.",18,87,Rosé,Italy,France,0
55278,"Soft, ripe and fruity, this is an attractive, ready-to-drink wine. Its juicy red fruits are balanced with tannins, offering a dry contrast. The finish is dark, structured and suggestive of the wine's potential for aging.",12,87,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,France,1
88539,"Light-bodied and lacking in tannin, this is a more traditional Barbera, with attractive mixed berry fruit on the nose, followed by forest floor and graham cracker flavors in the mouth. Drink now.",15,86,Barbera,Italy,Italy,1
56917,"Very similar to the 2006, Kameron's '07 Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is upfront in blackberry, cherry, cassis, oak and spice flavors. It's quite tannic, with a puckery astringency that suggests needed time in the cellar. Better after 2014.",55,91,Red Blend,US,US,1
8264,"This Montsant white is oily and oaky on the nose. The palate on this Garnacha Blanca is plump feeling, with decent acidity and full flavors of papaya and melon. This finishes oily in feel, with green notes and scallion flavors. Only 500 cases made.",17,86,Garnacha Blanca,Spain,Spain,1

87190,"This gorgeous wine exhibits beautiful sophistication and austere aromas of elegant spice, candied fruit, licorice and maple syrup. It has aged beautifully thus far and promises a bright future ahead. The mouthfeel is tight and polished with firm tannins and exceptional integrity of fruit.",140,93,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Italy,Italy,1

1747,"Wet slate minerality leads the brisk, tightly wound nose. On the palate, the wine is a bit perfumed, at least for how tight the nose is, with elements of crisp apple, pear and a touch of nectarine.",45,87,Chardonnay,US,France,0
46916,"There's sweet dark cherry and plum fruit here, but to get to it you need to give the sulfur on the nose time to blow off. When it does, the wait is worth it. A full, lush mouthfeel caresses your palate, and the finish is dry and even. Decant if drinking now, or wait a year or two.",18,89,Sangiovese,Italy,Italy,1
75658,"Comes down on the rustic side, but for the price it's pretty good for a dry Cabernet. Shows the variety's full-bodied fanciness in the blackberry, currant, cocoa and licorice flavors, with a rich steak of vanilla oak.",10,85,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
35835,"Aging quickly, this tastes principally of raisins and brown sugar. The tannins are soft and the wine is at or slightly past its peak. Drink up.",30,84,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
13179,"A rich Chardonnay, with plenty to offer. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth, with dry flavors of citrus, tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast, and brisk, clean acidity.",18,87,Chardonnay,US,US,1
980,"This range of wines comes from different regions of the southwest. The white comes from Gascony and is typical local blend. It is crisp and fruity with a soft texture from the ripe Colombard. There is a light dancing character to this lively, fruity wine. Drink now.",11,85,Colombard-Sauvignon Blanc,France,France,1
17425,"Ultraconcentrated and almost heavy on the nose, but not fully syrupy or leaden. Has a heavy disposition in the mouth, with brown sugar, caramel and other usual suspects making up the flavor profile. Creamy and chunky on the finish. Excellent dessert wine for the price.",14,91,Pedro Ximénez,Spain,Spain,1
73347,"This is gorgeous with a delicate but intense bouquet of pressed rose, wet earth, licorice cola and dried berry fruit. The mouthfeel is incredibly long and silky.",55,93,Nebbiolo,Italy,Italy,1
15866,"A soft, fat, caramel-flavored wine, showing strawberry fruits and a creamy texture. It lacks acidity, leaving a wine that needs to be drunk soon.",22,84,Rosé,France,France,1
6144,"The dryness and low alcohol are praiseworthy, but more challenging are hard tannins and biting acidity. With blackberry and sweet green-herb flavors, it's the opposite of today's ripe cult style, but by no means unattractive.",25,86,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,France,0
10630,"A good, dry, elegant wine, fully ready to drink now with a nice steak. It's a complex Merlot, with layers of black cherries, licorice, cola and spices, as well as a pleasant touch of smoky oak.",18,87,Merlot,US,US,1
17599,"Rusciano is a blend of Syrah and Nero d'Avola that displays impressive depth and complexity. Aromas of dark fruit, spice, black currant and earthy tobacco build in intensity as the wine evolves in the glass. The finish is smooth and rich.",32,90,Red Blend,Italy,Italy,1
100075,"With its deep, tart-sweet black-plum aromas and flavors wrapped in a toasty oak blanket, this is an appealing, modern-style Barbera. The grape's native acidity is well tamed, but enough remains to make it a great food match. Has good tannic structure, yet has immediate appeal. Finishes long, dark and handsome.",17,88,Barbera,Italy,Italy,1
9161,"Generous and rounded, this wine combines the opulence of Volnay with a strongly tannic character coming from the old vines. Together, it's a rich, fruit-filled wine that is backed by a dry core and fragrant red berry acidity. Drink from 2018.",64,92,Pinot Noir,France,France,1
9434,"The aromas seem quite dried out, with notes of fruit leather, medicine cabinet and green herbs. The palate brings more of the same, seeming more advanced than its age might indicate.",34,87,Cabernet Franc,US,France,0
27963,"Crisp and fruity, this is a classic rosé. It shows a lightness that comes from the delicately handled fruits, giving gentle berry flavors, bright acidity and a textured aftertaste.",20,88,Rosé,France,France,1
46601,"For fans of grassy, gooseberry-accented wines. Lemon and lime show here, too, with decent acidity. Tiny amounts of Semillon and Chardonnay add dimension. It's fruity and simple, very clean (as you'd expect), a touch sweet and finishes swiftly.",10,84,Sauvignon Blanc,US,France,0
9473,"This tasty, toasty red wine is all Sangiovese. The tangy red berry fruit flavors carry highlights of peppery herbs. With some air time the wine smoothes out and rolls into a creamy, mocha-infused finish.",29,90,Sangiovese,US,Italy,0
71987,"Very ripe and almost sweet in jammy, pie-filling cherries and raspberries, with a rich seasoning of cinnamon, brown sugar and cocoa. But it's technically dry, and has a crispness from fine Arroyo Seco acidity. Drink now.",35,87,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
103125,"A pretty wine with aromas of black-cherry liqueur and a dash of espresso, or maybe it's the other way around. Round, full and lushly flavored. The high acidity gives it real bite; in fact, the finish is somewhat bitter because of it. Food will soften it up nicely.",20,86,Merlot,US,US,1
15267,"This easy Sangiovese should pair with a pizza or a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. There are mild fruit flavors here, followed by sun-drenched aromas of leather and spice.",8,83,Sangiovese,Italy,Italy,1
30542,"The excellent aromas show the muscle and meat typical of the better Syrahs, and the concentrated palate is a well-crafted blend of brambly berry, pepper, sea salt, cured meat and loam.",20,90,Syrah,US,France,0
67031,"Very consistent in style with previous vintages, this textural, lemony, racy Riesling seems bone dry, though it is noted as having 1% residual sugar. Along with rich flavors of grapefruit and citrus, there are nectarine and pear fruit highlights and a sharp minerality.",24,92,Riesling,US,France,0
6578,"This opens with earthy aromas of scorched soil, overripe plum, leather and a funky whiff of farmyard. On the palate, notes of game, clove and sage join raw red cherry offset by bracing tannins.",25,87,Nebbiolo,Italy,Italy,1
83663,"A delicious and interesting white wine, made from a variety more usually used for blending purposes. It's honey-rich but dry, similar in structure to an oaky Chardonnay, with tropical fruit and vanilla flavors that have a pleasant touch of bitterness.",30,90,Grenache Blanc,US,France,0
84266,"This is a bright and fruit-forward red wine from Piedmont in Northern Italy that exhibits prominent, but not overly intense or intrusive, aromas of fresh fruit, exotic spice and drying mineral. The wine has a fresh acidic component balanced by a jammy, sweet finish.",45,90,Barbera,Italy,Italy,1
72340,"Simple and seemingly sweet, this Chardonnay has apricot jam flavors.",11,81,Chardonnay,US,US,1
42784,"With too much oak and too sweet fruit, the result is an unbalanced Chardonnay. It tastes like LifeSaver lemon candies cooked into a baked Alaska dessert.",30,82,Chardonnay,US,US,1
98565,"Firm and muscular, this delivers powerful, concentrated red currant, cherry and berry fruit, tightly wrapped and resonant. Young and compact, the wine just begins to hint at the complexity it contains, with notes of herb, leaf and barrel spice. Good weight and concentration, plus exceptional length and precision.",55,92,Merlot,US,France,0
12524,"Very ripe, with sun-enriched blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors, and rich in sweet, dusty tannins. The finish on this polished, gentle Cab is a little sweet and oaky. Drink now.",24,86,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
59803,"Here's a Cabernet to age for a while. It's very dry and richly flavored in classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, with finely ground, intense tannins. But it has a youthful immaturity that simply isn't ready to appreciate now. Really needs time for all the parts to mesh together. Give it until 2012, and it should develop bottle complexity for another 5–6 years.",100,92,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,France,0
58805,"This is bizarrely perfumed: It tastes like a candy shop smells, with a note of fruit jelly. The tannins are taut, but the wine doesn't hang together.",19,82,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,France,1
33019,"This wine in a box is simple and direct, with pineapple, lime and peach flavors that are sugary sweet. But it's crisp and clean in acidity, and the box is the equivalent of four regular bottles.",20,83,White Blend,US,US,1
29049,"From both Muscat Canelli (65%) and Muscat Giallo (35%), this fragrant and inviting wine is exactly what it proclaims to be, slightly sweet in honeysuckle, citrus and crisp texture. It offers lightness and lingering acidity in a moderate-alcohol package.",16,90,Muscat,US,Italy,0
44669,"Aged in American oak, with mostly similar vineyard sources. The American oak, with more spice to the fruit, and less smoothness overall than the C'est Belle Bottling. Cherry and berry flavors abound; it's sturdy, solid and well-made. Just 170 cases produced.",35,88,Syrah,US,US,1
80019,"The complexities of Burgundy! This is the vineyard next to the more familiar Les Charmes, just up the slope—hence dessus, meaning above. This vineyard gives a mineral character, hinting at Chablis, but with some Meursault richness as well. Hold this wine, with its delicious vanilla flavors, and it will be ready in a year.",69,93,Chardonnay,France,France,1
82658,"Porty and dull. Almost undrinkable, except for some decent berry and currant flavors.",22,80,Tempranillo,US,Spain,0
100304,"Smells like ripe peaches with hints of anise and almond. Tastes similar, with a plump mouthfeel that carries the flavors across the palate to a short but pleasant finish. Nice as an apéritif, or with mildly flavored fish or poultry.",23,87,Cortese,Italy,Italy,1
90771,"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percentages of Alicante and Petit Verdot that render a soapy, herbal nose with accents of root beer, exotic spice, lavender potpourri and green pepper corn. It is very well balanced.",55,92,Red Blend,Italy,US,0
38553,"Very dry and fairly tannic, it's severe on first sip and hard to appreciate, although there are some good black cherry, cola, leather, oak and black pepper flavors. It's complex in its own way, and gets better as it breathes in the glass. Give it a good, long decanting, and drink it now through 2018. The blend is Mourvèdre, Grenache, Syrah and Counoise, in that order.",55,90,Rhône-style Red Blend,US,France,0
56668,"Waxy on the nose, with buttercup, creamy yellow-fruit scents and white flowers. The palate is wet, racy and a touch like soda, with sweet, candied flavors of peach and melon. Plods along with good enough acidity to support the wine's core sweetness and candied qualities.",15,86,Chardonnay,Spain,US,0
85732,"Starts out rustic and leathery, with hints of smoke, leafiness and earth along with baked berry and spice. This four-grape wine has good density and mouthfeel that frames leather, earth and slightly baked berry fruit flavors. Finishes chocolaty and sweet, with just enough acidity to maintain balance.",15,89,Red Blend,Spain,Spain,1
65616,"A wonderfully dry, minerally Sauvignon Blanc. It's set off by crisp acidity, and has rewarding flavors of lemons, grapefruits and limes, enriched with pineapples, figs and honeysuckle.",12,88,Sauvignon Blanc,US,France,0
34966,"Firm, a bit astringent and dry, with ripe flavors of blackberries, currants, black cherries and cedar. A solid Cabernet with some raw edges that might age out in a few years.",38,87,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
9368,"Dripping in earth, kir and fresh raspberry, this is a stellar wine from the heart of the appellation, estate-grown from a four-acre spot planted to a trio of clones. Spirited and refreshing, it dances in acidity and a floral back note that's compelling, wrapped in cinnamon and mocha.",42,94,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
79358,"Has all the hallmarks of Viognier, namely lots of tropical fruit, wildflower, vanilla and spicy aromas and flavors, and finishes thoroughly dry. Could use more brightness and zest, though, as it's a bit flat.",24,83,Viognier,US,France,0
76952,"Smokey tones of charcoal and dark granite or slate rise from the nose of this Lazio-based Petit Verdot. Dusty mineral notes are followed by dark, ripe fruit and the wine is long-lasting and penetrating on the close.",24,88,Petite Verdot,Italy,Italy,1
98297,"Kind of tough in the mouth at this time, with aggressive tannins that effectively bury the blackberry flavors. There's also a streak of hung meat or smoky leather that adds dimension. Best to let it soften for a few years.",26,87,Zinfandel,US,US,1
74833,"This is a difficult wine to understand, with a very specific philosophy behind it. Light, elegant and ethereal, the 60-40 blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato is aged in terracotta amphorae in a studied attempt to present as pure a product as nature allows. It offers loads of bright fruit, wild berries, earth, spice and impressive complexity.",40,91,Red Blend,Italy,Italy,1
46438,"Here's an oak-aged Chardonnay from northern Italy that offers the bright intensity of peach, melon and yellow flower backed by the elegance of toast and roasted nut. The wine is creamy and soft in the mouth with some bitter almond notes on the close.",30,88,Chardonnay,Italy,Italy,1
99683,"Defines a style entirely separate from Napa's. Has those rustic Dry Creek tannins and even a briary edge to the blackberries and cherries, and is totally dry. Well-made and elegant.",13,88,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
90189,"Oaky and ripe, with powerful tropical pineapple, kumquat, mineral and floral aromas and flavors. New oak adds smoke, vanilla and char. The bottom line is of a flavorful, acidic and elegant Chard with a lingering, spicy finish.",28,90,Chardonnay,US,US,1
92483,"Smooth and ripe smelling, with clean berry aromas. Cherry, plum and pepper are the lead flavors, and the feel is tangy, zippy and clampy, but exceedingly fresh. Not a lot of richness, depth or body here, but it's pure, clean wine with common appeal.",14,87,Tempranillo,Spain,Spain,1
15243,"Just a single barrel was made, pure Sangiovese from the Candy Mountain Vineyard. Tight, tart and dark, it captures black cherry fruit with black licorice and a whiff of smoke. At this point in time the tannins and acids seem to be fighting it out for control.",50,88,Sangiovese,US,Italy,0
13506,"Something like a cross between a silky Pinot Noir and a soft Merlot, this is a gentle, fruity wine, with berry, tobacco, cola and spice flavors. A nice scour of tannins suggests this will pair with rich, oily meats and cheeses.",16,86,Sangiovese,US,Italy,0
30055,"Simple cherry fruit, with a delicately earthy base, defines this everyday Merlot. It keeps its herbal component in check, balanced appropriately against rather light fruit.",18,87,Merlot,US,US,1
5707,"Date and tar notes come nuanced with a funky, sweat-like aroma. The palate feels lax on attack, and it tastes a bit thin on flavor. Firm, upper-lip-grabbing tannins mark the finish.",26,83,Merlot,US,France,0
4900,"It's certainly tannic and tough at the moment, the wine also has so much fruit. That will allow it to round out, bringing out the black currant fruitiness and resulting in a full, rich and perfumed wine. Wait until 2018.",24,88,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,France,1
60657,"Crisp and refreshing with notes of grated ginger, white flowers and cantaloupe. This dry Riesling balances peachy fruit flavors with a steely backbone of slate and lime, tart acidity and a pleasantly long finish. Lovely all around.",16,89,Riesling,US,France,0
80671,"This is light and generic, the sort of low-priced Merlot that California cranks out by the boatload. Washington can do better. There's a spiffy new label, but where's the beef?",9,82,Merlot,US,US,1
19934,"Intense blueberry and blackberry notes penetrate through this fruity, forward Pinot Noir. Hints of savory herbs add elegance to an otherwise one-dimensional palate that finishes with big, coarse tannins.",22,84,Pinot Noir,US,US,1

40930,"The Chelan region is Washington's newest AVA, but already showing great potential for Syrah, as this aromatic and explosively flavorful bottle proves. Ripe berries, plums and cherries are swept into a mix of smoke and rock and iron filings; as you taste through the wine there are citrusy acids and hints of resin and tar; it just keeps adding in the nuances.",27,90,Syrah,US,US,1
46436,"Well structured, balanced, giving tannins as well as acidity to balance fruit that moves in the direction of sweet plums, with hints of coffee and vanilla spice. The wine has a texture that promises aging, but also has a delicious juicy character.",55,91,Pinot Noir,France,France,1
16828,"Huge flavors of jammy blackberries and cherries dominate this Syrah, with a coating of sweet, caramelized oak. It's yummy, but not especially complex. Drink now.",26,86,Syrah,US,US,1

64063,"Ripeness is both this wine's blessing and its challenge. It's super-fruit in jammy blackberries, blueberries, currants and cherries, brightened by that famous Edna Valley acidity. But it's all on the surface, without much complexity. So drink now.",24,86,Syrah,US,US,1

95521,"A very nice Chardonnay that has the dusty, herbal tug that Napa Chards often display. Otherwise it's very rich, with potent pineapple pie and peach tart flavors, enriched with creamy lees and buttery new oak. Drink now–2012.",70,92,Chardonnay,US,US,1
47927,"Lightweight and thin in the mouth, this zesty white wine does a good job of keeping your palate refreshed and quenches your thirst (think hot summer day). It's an easy and informal wine that stays focused on simplicity.",14,85,Pinot Grigio,Italy,Italy,1
73726,"Old vines have produced a superconcentrated and ripe wine. It has notes of toast, spice and yellow fruit as well as bright acidity. With its structure, depth of flavor and density, it should age well over 3–4 years.",35,92,Sauvignon Blanc,France,France,1
399,"The nose of this blend of 58% Syrah, 17% Cabernet Franc, 9% Merlot, 8% Malbec and 8% Petite Sirah is a touch funky, with sour blackberry, charcoal and dried meat aromas. Charred blueberry, sour black plum and savory meat flavors show on the palate.",32,86,Red Blend,US,US,1
95369,"A rush of zippy, fresh fruit and spice aromas recommends this white from New York, offering the kind of clean fruit flavors and minerality that makes this region unique.

53359,"If you know the Rhône-style wines of Saxum, which is probably Paso Robles' most expensive wine, this is nearly identical. Mostly Syrah, with 8% Grenache, the wine is decadently rich in milk chocolate, blackberry jam and sweet, smoky oak flavors. It's very high in alcohol, but unless you're an extremist in this regard, you can't help but be knocked out by the wine's sensuous pleasures.",95,92,Rhône-style Red Blend,US,US,1

2327,"This beautiful wine further confirms the high level of quality in the Pinot Noirs from Dan Goldfield and Steve Dutton. It has a profusion of ripe black cherry and currant flavors, backed by firm acidity and fine-grained tannins, giving it grip.

94915,"An extraordinarily rich Pinot, fat and opulent in cherry compote, mocha and root beer flavors. Generously oaked, it offers spicy oak notes and a velvety texture.

79957,"Relatively tight and closed up at this stage, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development.

61983,"This is cool on the nose, with tree bark and tobacco aromas that come together well. Tannic and stout, it's not punishing, with a roasted black-fruit flavor and a backing of espresso bitterness. This shows a syrupy side and also raw power. Drink now–2018.",44,90,Tempranillo,Spain,Spain,1

103820,"Still dependable despite changes in ownership, this winery again delivers an elegant, well-made wine. With this vintage, it veers more toward herbaceous notes than fruity ones. The dominant flavors are of green olives and sweet bell pepper. Don't think, however, that it's lean. Oak provides fatness, and the right foods, like grilled red meat, will coax out the berry sweetness.",22,87,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1

On that basis, it's a place of great perfumes, coming through in the wine from wood as well as chunky black fruits. It is a relatively soft wine, the concentration in the dense fruit rather than the tannins.",40,91,Duras,France,France,1
64891,"This is bone dry, with plenty of acidity and tough tannins. It's not offering much relief, despite an evident core of blackberries, currants and cherries. Those tannins really lock the palate down, like a sandpaper straitjacket on the tongue. But you have to consider its origin in Yountville, a cool area noted for ageable wines. It hould begin to resolve its difficulties by 2016.",50,91,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
92418,"Packaged in a modern screwcap bottle, this friendly blend of Ribolla Gialla with smaller percentages of Friulano and Riesling delivers a bright golden color and lively fruit aromas of stone and passion fruits. The wine is crisp and lively in the mouth and perfectly captures the spirit of winemaking in Northeast Italy.",34,89,White Blend,Italy,Italy,1
83080,"A bit raw and rustic in texture, with a briary, green peppercorn mouthfeel that's scoury and tart in acids. Couple that with berry-cherry fruit, and you can a Zin that tastes sweet-and-sour. But it's very Zinny, and will wash down barbecue with ease.",28,84,Zinfandel,US,US,1
12533,"Will appeal broadly to many Pinot lovers for its soft, lush array of flavor. Raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice and bacon all lead to a long, spicy finish. Trades complexity for immediate appeal, so drink up.",50,88,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
82398,"Too heavy and soft, like a melted mocha-raspberry sundae. Lacks structure, which makes it taste too sweet.",10,82,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
21177,"Birch Creek Vineyard provides the fruit for this stainless-steel-fermented and aged wine. It offers notes of custard, lees and herbs. The clover flavors show a richer feel but the concentration doesn't all seem to be there, trailing toward the finish.",36,87,Sémillon,US,US,1
78306,"Almost stewy but not totally over the top. The nose offers more earth and oak than brightness, while the palate is herb-infused, with berry and tomato. Fairly classic in style, but not as fresh as desirable.",20,84,Sangiovese,Italy,Italy,1
49852,"Very dry and a little earthy, with a dusty hay or dried straw quality to the tangerine, sweet lime, lychee, peaches and cream flavors. An interesting, crisp Chard with plenty of nuanced complexity.",30,91,Chardonnay,US,France,0
45825,"Smells and tastes ungenerous, probably due to unripe grapes that give an earthy, vegetal taste to the wine. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",24,83,Red Blend,US,Italy,0
92181,"Nice, rugged mountain Zin, with the briary, brambly tannins and peppery taste of wild berries freshly picked off the vine. Alcohol adds heat and structure, and time in the barrel has softened the tannins. This might just be the perfect backyard barbecue red wine.",16,86,Zinfandel,US,US,1
90711,"Moody, complex and brooding, this is a superb wine and an exceptional value. Purple violets, black forest cake, cocoa nibs and espresso granules all abound on the nose, backed by dark juicy black raspberries. Full and firmly structured in the mouth with notes of pepper, tea, smoked meat and black fruit on the palate.",28,93,Syrah,France,France,1
48761,"A real surprise! Who in their right mind could expect so much quality from a Cab Franc-Tempranillo blend from Penedès? But try it and we guarantee you're going to like it. The nose is meaty, ripe and round, while the palate features pure core fruit backed by chocolaty warmth. With kick as well as subtlety, this is a bargain hunter's dream. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",12,91,Red Blend,Spain,Spain,1
81433,"Another good job at a relatively inexpensive white variety from Clos du Bois. With Lake and Sonoma county grapes, the wine shows good Sauvignon Blanc character. Dry and crisp, it's savory in lemongrass, grapefruit and peach flavors that are lightly oaked.",14,86,Sauvignon Blanc,US,US,1
30123,"A touch of oak influence lends smokiness to the lime, Meyer lemon and tropical fruit flavors. With its crisp acidity that creates a sweet-and-sour taste, this wine is for drinking now as a cocktail sipper or with ham or Chinese food.",15,85,Sauvignon Blanc,US,US,1
40009,"A very tasty wine, loaded with fleshy, fruity flavor. The dominant note is fresh cut pear, dappled with cinnamon spice. Round and balanced, it's a delicious bottle with just a slight hint of residual sweetness.",16,88,Pinot Gris,US,Italy,0

52998,"A pretty good Pinot Noir, dry and elegantly constructed, with crisp acidity and a backbone of tannins. The flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit are delicious, but the texture is scoury and a little warm, even though the alcohol is relatively low.",30,86,Pinot Noir,US,France,0
72299,"Polished and sophisticated, with lush green apple, pineapple, buttered toast and cinnamon flavors. Likeable for its balance and sheer drinkability.",20,88,Chardonnay,US,US,1
38074,"From young vintner Giovanni Abrigo in the Treiso area, this is a lovely expression of Barbaresco with immediate aromas of cherry, cassis, spice, smoke, leather and tobacco. The wine is approachable now, but it's also built to last: natural concentration, bright fruit flavors and acidity will hold ten years or more.",35,93,Nebbiolo,Italy,Italy,1
63785,"Rooty and earthy smelling, this has aromas of leather, cassis, tobacco, dried cheese and cola. It feels rich and nicely textured, with firm but friendly tannins that set up tobacco, coffee, mocha and roasted berry flavors. It's chocolaty in an uncanny way on the finish. Drink now through 2018.",70,93,Tempranillo,Spain,Spain,1
39074,"Without a doubt one of the most successful vineyard crus in Barbaresco, Rabajà delivers unique intensity and sophistication. You'll notice aromas of black fruit, spice, tar and licorice and there's good balance between the wine's acidity and its tannic structure. Pair this wine with roasted pork stuffed with prunes.",52,91,Nebbiolo,Italy,Italy,1
79426,"Michel Laroche has been branching out of Chablis in recent years and his southern French effort has some chlorine notes along with aromas of mint and sweet wood. The power is up there, but there isn't suppleness to match. The palate pulsates while the finish is dark and sharp, with a burnt flavor.",7,82,Merlot,France,France,1
17247,"Like almost all of Reverie's Cabernets on release, this one needs time in the cellar. Tasted in fall 2011, it's tight and grapey, with blackberry jam flavors girded by a firm, stony minerality and sweet, but hard, tannins. Give it 6–8 years.",75,92,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
55295,"This pure Mourvèdre begins well, offering a full palate of varietal flavors that are built upon a mix of citrus and ripe tree fruits, along with accents of leaf and forest. It turns soft and seems a bit overripe, running into a rather short finish.",35,87,Mourvèdre,US,France,0

25540,"Here's a simple and fruity Nero d'Avola that offers fleeting blackberry and tart red-cherry flavors alongside fresh acidity. Pair this with pizza or with other everyday, informal meals.",13,85,Nero d'Avola,Italy,Italy,1
22441,"A sub-brand of Riunite, Albinea Canali's Ottocentonero shows simple, easy lines with raw fruit, cherry and almond paste. It's a dry Lambrusco without some of the bitterness you sometimes encounter with these wines.",13,84,Lambrusco,Italy,Italy,1
86040,"When this bottling is from a ripe vintage, it can be quite good. But the cool 2007 harvest has yielded a somewhat green wine. It has grapefruit and gooseberry flavors that veer into feline territory.",20,84,Sauvignon Blanc,US,France,0
2394,"The aromas of lemon, soil and flowers are quite subdued. The flavors are restrained with impressive balance and the variety's often burly tannins well tamed.",32,89,Petite Verdot,US,France,0
92591,"Coming from such a cool climate, this Cab isn't as opulent or ripe as, say, Napa. There's a wintergreen mint note alongside the sweet red cherry and black raspberry flavors, and a lightly elegant weight. It's a different kind of Cab, but a dry, good one, and very friendly with food.",35,87,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,France,0
44060,"Lots of ripe, jammy cherry, blackberry and chocolate fruit in this easy-drinking Cab. Shows some rusticity, though, in the raisiny finish and astringency of the tannins.",14,83,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
51598,"With aromas of milk-chocolate-covered cherries and forced oak, this smells overtly sweet and candied. This feels choppy and juicy, with red fruit flavors and buttery oak in the background. It turns sweeter and more buttery on the finish, but doesn't offer much complexity.",15,83,Grenache Blend,Spain,US,0
74895,"Sangiovese with 25% Merlot for added softness and dimension, this wine boasts pretty notes of cherry, blue flowers, toasted almonds and exotic spice. It has nice elegance overall but is a bit compact in the mouth.",15,87,Sangiovese,Italy,Italy,1
95897,"This luminous Pinot Grigio opens with simple aromas of stone fruit, melon and citrus and delivers fine levels of acidity and enough structure to carry forward with fish pasta or risotto. The wine performs nicely in the mouth thanks to its creamy texture.",20,86,Pinot Grigio,Italy,Italy,1
30098,"The most tannic and closed of Vine Cliff's magnificent array of '07 Cabernets. It's hard, with a bite of acidity, but it doesn't take much for the richness to explode. Blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, butterscotch, sweet cinnamon spice, the list goes on and on. So rich and decadent, you can enjoy it now, but it will gather momentum over the next 6–8 years.",150,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
32989,"Mild salinic aromas bring lime and lychee. Feels standard and smooth enough, with sweet white fruit flavors that suggest peach. As a semi-dry, it always feels and tastes sugary.",9,84,Sparkling Blend,Spain,Spain,1
44466,"Fresh berry aromas carry some spice notes, while the palate is rugged and a little hot. Juicy berry flavors are forward but not overly evolved or complex, and the the finish is tight and aggressive. Spunky and clean, with honest flavors.",14,86,Tinto del Pais,Spain,Spain,1
49721,"With 14 months' new wood aging, this wine is still all wood and toast. The wine does have weight, with the promise of blackberry fruits under the firm tannins. It is finely structured and should mature well.",18,89,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,France,1
92379,"Erath's fresh and lightly fruity Pinot Gris is a bit more substantial than this new Pinot Blanc. Soft and fruity, this is a simple wine which does not challenge the palate in any way. All stainless steel fermented, it is the quintessential quaffer.",14,84,Pinot Blanc,US,US,1
53275,"Winemaker Denis Malbec has created a brilliantly delicious, crisp, dry yet richly textured version of the variety that opens with golden honey, dried apricot and lychee on the nose and mouth. Very minerally, the wine has a steely finish with smoky, oaky edges.",36,91,Sauvignon Blanc,US,France,0
19663,"A hearty Cabernet rich in cranberry and cassis with streaks of earthy cedar and a pleasant herbal undertone. The tannins are young still, pleading to wait until 2017–2019 in the bottle, or for some air before enjoying.",35,89,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
73278,"Curiously perfumed with notes of roasted hazelnuts and fresh apples, this is a savory, dry Chardonnay. Full bodied in style with notes of nut oil and nut skins throughout, it ends with a hint of wood sap astringency on the finish.",15,83,Chardonnay,US,US,1
18987,"Thanks to its dense clay soils, the Brunate cru delivers wines with high color saturation and aromatic caliber. This Barolo offers layers of black fruit, plum, spice, tobacco, cola and dark chocolate. The wine is firm and finely textured with power, dimension and personality on the long finish.",88,94,Nebbiolo,Italy,Italy,1
93934,"A wine searching for an identity. The nose deals menthol, licorice, grilled meat and molasses but little-to-no bright fruit. That heaviness transfers to the mouth, where marinated, baked flavors mix with green tomato. Fails to impress.",36,83,Tinto del Pais,Spain,Spain,1
34222,"A pale pink color introduces this wine, as do fairly weak aromas of bubble gum and freshly squeezed lime. This is one of three rosés made by Proulx, and they are all rather subtle in expression, this one delivering a bit of lime and decent amount of tannic grip to the palate. It would be a great match for anything rich in texture but light in flavor, as it could be easily overwhelmed.",24,86,Rosé,US,France,0
74042,"For any serious fan of Rivesaltes, this is a must-have example. Aromas of dried apricot, toasted hazelnut, fig, ginger, sweet spice and candied orange rind fill the bouquet, while the mouth is silky and balanced—sweet and heady without being cloying. All of the aromas transition onto the palate alongside accents of walnut skins and shiitake mushroom. Soft salinity makes the long finish even more mouthwatering. Drink now, or continue to age. There are 869 bottles produced.",350,95,Red Blend,France,France,1
23768,"Epineuil is a region between Burgundy and Chablis, producing light, fruity Pinot Noir. This perfumed and dusty wine does show some firm tannins. It is bright with red currant and raspberry fruits, with a fresh aftertaste.",23,87,Pinot Noir,France,France,1
75581,"This 12-year old shows signs of maturity, but retains freshness and liveliness as well. With its yeasty edge, toasty flavors and wonderful white fruits all in balance, it is finely balanced. The acidity is kept in check by the richness of the mature fruit. A very complete Champagne.",95,94,Chardonnay,France,France,1
95624,"You sure can taste the sunny, fruity extract in this wine. It's massive in black cherry liqueur, cassis and mocha-choca flavors. It's also very soft, with a long, almost sweet finish.",29,85,Zinfandel,US,US,1
47575,"and sweet, with candied cherry, raspberry and carob flavors. Tasty enough, but seriously lacks the acidity to make this fruity wine come alive. From Cartlidge & Browne.",35,83,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
91923,"Just like the '07, this is a blend of 60% Grenache Bl;anc, 20% Marsanne and 20% Roussanne, featuring ripe melon and peach fruit wrapped around an underlying minerality. It's full and broad, yet manages to be refreshing despite its weightiness.",12,87,White Blend,France,France,1
93529,"An intensely mineral expression of Sauvignon Blanc, crisp, full of citrus flavors, deliciously fresh, but also complex. The wine is concentrated into a steel spring of ripeness, ready to burst from the glass.",22,92,Sauvignon Blanc,France,France,1
53814,"This is grandiose, with ripe apricot and peach flavors—even a note of mango—that are allied to the wood notes. As a contrast, there is fine acidity and elegance, with a lemon zest edge that gives structure to this full, superripe, powerful effort.",125,93,Chardonnay,France,France,1
14185,"This hearty red wine from central Italy would pair well with grilled meat or veal wrapped in sage leaves and sliced prosciutto ham. Loads of red berries are followed by notes of exotic spice, leather, tobacco and firm tannins. Drink in 3–5 more years.",22,91,Red Blend,Italy,Italy,1
62174,"From Dijon clones, this sculpted, tight, compact Chardonnay feels as if it is shut in a cocoon. Give it time (and decanting) to unwrap, and it shows elegant tropical and stone fruits, caramel, vanilla cream and butter flavors, backed with moderate acids.",28,88,Chardonnay,US,France,0
81790,"This debut blend somehow reaches 15% alcohol, not easy to do with Yakima Valley Sangiovese. It's a solid effort, which opens well—supple and polished, with pretty flavors of mixed plum and berry. It's silky, smooth and there's plenty of tangy fruit. The finish gets a little too hot, but that's a minor quibble in a wine that gives you this much flavor at this price. The finish keeps getting more and more interesting, piling on smoked ham and spicy clove as it goes.",20,90,Red Blend,US,US,1
37199,"Texture is the name of the game here. We're talking pure velvet, the way the wine glides over the palate with hardly a wrinkle. Beyond the mouthfeel are flavors so complex, they're hard to describe. The blend consists of Cabernet Sauvignon, with contributions from Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, and each grape brings its own distinction, as does 100% new oak. It's approachable now for the softness, and should glide through the next 6–8 years with ease. Expensive, yes, and only 344 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.",90,95,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1

65581,"Less immediately accessible than the 2005, the 2006 is tight and tart and almost seems encased in some sort of a shell. The fruit is concentrated raspberry and plum, and the acids taste natural while the tannins are polished and proportionate. The wine stays focused and strong through a very long finish that dapples in toasted coconut and chocolate malt. If you are a Rollat collector (and you should be) this would be the wine to cellar for five or six years, waiting for the Edouard to come into full flower.",45,92,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,France,0

36794,"The year 2007 is not going to go down in the books as a good one for Ribera del Duero. Many of the young wines, like this one, are showing narrow, sour fruit and too much funk and pickle. Here, there's a touch of jamminess and red fruit but mostly it's another thin, pushy wine with anemic flavors and a rough mouthfeel. Stick with the 2006 if you can find it.",20,83,Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Spain,1
19554,"Some years ago, Willamette Valley Vineyards purchased the Tualatin Estate vineyards and winery founded by Bill Fuller in 1973.

60440,"Fattoria Scopone's 2004 Riserva opens with charred aromas of campfire, liquid smoke and barbecue sauce. The fresh fruit notes tend to be on the ripe side: think mature cherry and strawberry.

80057,"Morellino di Scansano is known in Italy as an informal, fruit-forward wine that washes down beautifully with heaping plates of pasta and home cooked meals. This expression follows squarely in that tradition and offers perky aromas of cherry cola, spice, blackberry and dried Mediterranean herbs.",25,87,Sangiovese,Italy,Italy,1

Richness and depth prevail throughout.",55,93,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
11727,"I have seldom tasted a Dry Creek Valley Cabernet (the appellation, not the winery) that didn't have a woolly edge to it. This wine is an excellent example.

86896,"Light berry fruit, alcohol around 13%, a pale color, and plenty of acidity characterize this Pinot Noir. Still tightly wound, it may add some flesh with further bottle age. The aromas hint at tomato leaf, and the wine fades gently.",30,87,Pinot Noir,US,France,0
8309,"Another successful 2011 from this winery, in fact the best of their six new Pinots. Shows the brilliant acidity and light, delicate texture of the coast, with the concentrated fruit, cola and spice flavors this esteemed vineyard is noted for. Highly complex and dry, it's delicious to drink now, and should age well for a good six years.",54,94,Pinot Noir,US,US,1

74706,"This blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah has a lot of heat and power locked within, recognized by slightly cooked or jammy fruit notes. But you'll also get very pleasant, warm tones of soft leather and sweet pipe tobacco.",28,87,Red Blend,Italy,US,0
40114,"Made from 100% Cabernet, this wine is very extracted and jammy, in the modern style of extreme ripeness and fruit-forwardness. Sweet oak, 70% of it new, adds layers of cream, vanilla and buttered toast. Appeals now for its juicy, New World style.",85,90,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1

8306,"A rich Riesling, just off dry, balancing intense acidity with white currant, hedgerow fruits and a concentrated texture. The wine is full-bodied, very ripe and superbly structured. Very fruity now, this is a wine to show how well Riesling can age—give it 6–8 years.",39,94,Riesling,France,France,1
98894,"Our unanimous favorite of the tasting, La Prima comes from the oldest vines on the property, and is a blend of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino aged in barriques. Dark color, with black plums and hints of violets on the nose, the oak is understated, allowing the blackberry, plum and floral notes to shine through. Finishes rich, chewy and long.",35,90,Sangiovese,Italy,Italy,1
38566,"Made with southern Italy's most noble white grape, this structured wine conveys subtle aromas of white and yellow spring flowers accented by whiffs of beeswax and slate. The juicy palate delivers white peach, cantaloupe, pink grapefruit and mineral alongside fresh acidity.",37,90,Greco,Italy,Italy,1
13320,"Made by Carabella, this popular budget Pinot sports solid, country flavors. Plenty of bright, vivid and tart fruit—berries and cherries—give it a full-bodied, forward expression. But it's not all front-loaded; there is surprising depth, and overall a fine balance.",20,88,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
99379,"This is a young, tight wine. It stuns with strong acidity and a bitter lime zest, almost gooseberry tartness. But it's nobly structured, and badly in need of a year or two in the cellar, or extended decanting. Oxygen and warming up bring out exciting notes of tropical fruits, buttercream and oak.",36,92,Chardonnay,US,France,0
1008,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this robust wine opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, mature plum, toast and roasted coffee bean.

91702,"The '05, as befits a cool vintage, is lean, with the alcohol showing through bare-bones citrus flavors. Even those who like their whites dry and flinty may find this Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier blend a little thin.",40,86,Rhône-style White Blend,US,France,0
16098,"A solid wine, with plum skin and dry tannin textures. It does have the ripe fruit of 2009, attractive red fruits and juicy acidity. But it needs aging over at least three years to show its fruitiness.",50,91,Pinot Noir,France,France,1

2357,"Reflecting the heat of the vintage, aromas recall stewed prune, fig and toasted oak.

Searing alcohol dominates the finish.",100,86,Sangiovese,Italy,Italy,1
72384,"Really charming, with a nose of green plums, red berries and earth that jumps out of the glass and curls up in your lap. The palate is lacking a bit in intensity but makes up for it with iresistable cassis flavor followed by fresh-roasted coffee. The bracing acidity would be well matched by a cheese-laden dish such as lasagna. Drink now to one year.",9,86,Dolcetto,Italy,Italy,1
67930,"Moderately intense menthol, black licorice and African violets aromas on the nose.

They mingle together in a complex swirl that makes you want another sip.",30,89,Pinot Noir,US,US,1

26791,"Hard to keep from falling in love with this wine. It's so luscious in bright, spicy wild cherry, raspberry and root beer flavors. With a satiny texture and brilliant acidity, it's stunningly drinkable now, but should hold and develop over the next six years.",36,94,Pinot Noir,US,US,1

96754,"Cometa boasts a brilliant, saturated golden color and carries through with clean execution in terms of aromas and flavors. Notes of tropical fruit and ripe citrus come into sharp focus thanks to Fiano's natural minerality.

63754,"This tastes and feels a little gritty, with dry tannins. There's something old-fashioned about it, in an era of lush, sweet Cabernetss that appeal in their youth. A rich core of blackberry and black currant suggests that time in the cellar will be rewarded. Hold until 2017 or so.",52,88,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,France,0

103829,"Aromas of sun-dried tomatoes, coffee, cinnamon, toast, blackberries and currants introduce a wine that drinks light and fruity. Some pretty flavors here, with lots of spice and soft tannins. Nothing to write home about, but nice enough for a dry red table wine.",21,85,Merlot,US,US,1
92603,"Light raspberry along with charred wood carries the modest nose. Additional raspberry flavors blend with sweeter strawberry tastes to create a mildly creamy, easygoing palate.

56140,"One of two Tempranillos from Fenestra (the other from Lodi), the Livermore Valley version is bright, tasting of cherry spice, with good acidity. Nearing the finish the taste turns to toasty dark molasses; a nice wine overall.",36,87,Tempranillo,US,US,1
24368,There is a rosé here struggling to get out. This wine has strawberry fruits combined with tannins in a way that does not work. Bordeaux Clairet lies between rosé and red in color and in taste.,14,83,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,France,1

12682,"A mix of fruit that survived the big freeze, from Dwelley, Morrison Lane and Minnick vineyards. It's tight, tart and tannic, and showing some pickle barrel notes from time in new American oak.

91608,"The appellation is near the western, cooler part of Paso Robles, and the wine's rich chocolate fudge and creamy cherry and cassis flavors have the requisite acidity and tannins needed to temper them. Almost sweet on the finish, the wine redeems itself with elegance. The high alcohol isn't really a problem, in terms of balance.",26,88,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
15113,"Aged in large oak casks, this dark and thickly extracted Ripasso does a nice job of integrating mature black fruit aromas with spice and tobacco. The oak element is nicely tucked in the background and the wine shows bright fruit flavors in the mouth as well.",18,89,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Italy,Italy,1

67389,"Oak dominates this wine, withstrong notes of buttered toast, vanilla and sweet char. There's nothing wrong with those pleasant aromas and flavors, but the underlying wine, with its cherry and currant fruit, is overpowered by the wood.",20,85,Petite Sirah,US,US,1
57243,"Made from DuBrul Vineyard fruit, this has lush strawberry and raspberry flavors that dig deep into the core, supported by a base of minerality. The tightly-focused finish includes echoes of toasty barrel-derived flavors.",72,90,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1

20727,"Woody, brambly notes lend an earthy complexity to fresh blackberry and cassis notes on this bright, brisk Merlot. A shower of cranberry acidity jolts the palate and cuts through the fine, but penetrating tannins that fringe the finish. An elegant, refreshing example of a cool-climate Merlot.",20,88,Merlot,US,US,1
655,"From 100% estate-grown grapes, and possessing 6.8 g/L of residual sugar, this wine is lovely in peach, pear and lemon, and quite voluptuous in texture, with a hint of spice. Pretty floral aromas of jasmine provide additional flourish and invitation, with the finish dry.",25,90,Riesling,US,US,1
81834,"Here's an intense, nervy young Cab that impresses for its powerful oak and cassis flavors. It's a little sharp now, with an acidic jamminess and tea-like tannic structure that suggests moderate aging capability. Stash it until 2008, then open for a couple of years.",35,88,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
88693,"Firm, solid, chunky, a great success from a château that is currently in top form, even in more difficult years. The bright fruits charge through the tannins, giving some richness, balancing with the elegance and freshness of the year. Worth aging.",50,93,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,France,1
29835,"Bright and aggressive for Llopart, with lively orange and apricot aromas. Frothy to the point of being bubbly, with ripe, bouncy pink grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Stays racy and citrusy on the finish. All fruit; not complex.",22,88,Sparkling Blend,Spain,Spain,1
40864,"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.",15,86,Verdejo,Spain,Spain,1
63285,"With just 2% Syrah, this is a Bordeaux-style blend, feauturing mostly Cabernet and Merlot. The rich entry features berry, chocolate and espresso, with a round midpalate and polished tannins. A hint of tar runs through the finish.",29,88,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,France,0
20209,"Blue-flower and red-berry aromas lead the way along with a whiff of eucalyptus. The firm palate offers hints of star anise, espresso and a green note of powdered sage that back up unripe red cherry. It closes on a coffee note.",29,87,Red Blend,Italy,US,0
2579,"Layered botrytis that gives the wine both its richness and dense texture. It is sweet but with a dry core and crisp acidity, it will age well.

49767,"Lush, thick and chewy, with rich purple and black fruits, pepper and a finish of vanilla cream. The tannins are substantial but not intrusive; they carry a sensation of rock and graphite. Flavors extend themselves gracefully; the ripe fruit remains front and center, but it finishes with plenty of nuanced rock and spice and hints of herb. An exceptional effort.",28,92,Syrah,US,France,0

56560,"This needs air to show its best, because at first it's tight, mulchy and nutty. Early on, it feels clampy and scratchy, but it becomes better as it airs. The black fruit flavors are touched up by notes of oak, dried cheese and leather—characteristics that extend onto the finish.",62,89,Tempranillo,Spain,Spain,1
48031,"A very nice buy at this price. Dry and jammy, the wine features ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, anise, cocoa and mint, with smoky, oaky notes and mouthwateringly crisp coastal acidity.",10,85,Syrah,US,US,1
74140,"Obviously not in the first flush of youth, this dry rosé goes more for mature almond marzipan along with cranberry juice flavors to give some tightness to the texture. Definitely to be drunk now. Screwcap.",14,84,Cabernet Franc,France,France,1
70733,"The winery's most popular wine, Cali is 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot and 4% Sangiovese. Nice aromatics lead into a medium-bodied wine with bright spices, strawberry preserves, some sour plum, and defining acidity, with a lick of chocolate in the finish.",17,87,Red Blend,US,US,1

A blend of 65% Tempranillo, 20% Merlot and 15% Caberent Sauvignon.",24,88,Red Blend,Spain,Spain,1
17394,"Amazingly delicious and soft. Defines the modern Napa Cabernet style, with the tasteful elegance Hall wines are known for.

38876,"Seems sort of waxy and baked, with mildly acrid aromas of burnt corn leading the way. The palate has an o.k. feel but the flavors are rather bitter and burnt, and the fruit isn't pointed or expressive. May already be past its prime. Imported by Winery Exchange.",9,83,Verdejo,Spain,Spain,1

Best Buy.",8,90,Sauvignon Blanc,US,US,1
83478,"Nothing special about this blend of Tempranillo and Shiraz. In fact, it's more austere and less pleasing than the brand's basic 2007 Temp-Shiraz blend.

19242,"A terrific mouthfeel highlights this mix of berry and cherry fruits, toast and cinnamon.

There's a nice high note suggesting citrus, even grapefruit; below that some racy berry fruit flavors; then comes the impact of tannin and espresso. It all adds up to some real excitement in the mouth. A powerful wine that zings the palate and leaves you wanting more.",39,91,Meritage,US,US,1
22956,"Briny citrus, feline notes and pithy scents send this Merseguera-led blend toward a pulpy, citrusy palate. Grapefruit and pithy, lightly bitter flavors finish citric, with little change from the wine's primary flavors.",9,85,White Blend,Spain,Spain,1
35337,"A delicious Talley Rincon, showing the class of this vineyard. Maybe not the best vintage, lacking some elegance, but the wine is ultrarich and full-bodied, with massive raspberry and cherry flavors. Drink soon.",58,90,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
2660,"This wine features tempting clove, black cherry and pomegranate flavors. It has great balance, an easygoing texture and a clean, fruity finish. It's medium to full bodied, but the oaky flavors and tannins stay well within bounds.",14,89,Syrah,US,US,1
89381,"Rich in cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors, this Rhône blend has sweet-and-sour berry-cherry flavors. It's rich in dry, furry tannins. Needs something big and meaty to soften it, like beef stew.",11,84,Red Blend,US,France,0
49992,"In 2003 the vineyard was going through some changes, and the vintage, the shift in focus and the winemaker's predilection for early picking seemed to conspire to produce a rather thin, austere wine. It's locked up tight, a bit herbal and lean, not yet revealing itself even with aeration. It's one of those mystery wines that you keep coming back to, waiting for the light to blink on.",30,88,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,France,0

80191,"This is blended from two finished wines: a 2005 Counoise (64%) and a 2006 Viognier (36%). It's ripe and round and showing strawberry and peach flavors. The two grapes work together well, and create a seamless wine with plenty of fruit power.",18,86,Rosé,US,France,0

32939,"Lots of delicious raspberry and cherry flavors in this spicy wine, but it's just too sweet. That's probably a combination of residual sugar and extraordinarily high alcohol of 16.5%, which makes it almost Port-like.",35,87,Zinfandel,US,US,1
66675,"Cabernet Franc has been the signature wine for Barrister since the first release in 2001. Once again it comes out dark and smoky in the house style, but with more spine and muscle than the Barrister Merlot.

40143,"Wow—delicious, the best yet. Lots of pineapple from the 75% Celilo fruit, very crisp and lightly butterscotchy. Big but not heavy, with alcohol in the mid-13% range. The wine fills in the midpalate nicely, weaving together rock, metal, butter and tropical fruit flavors in equal proportions. Good length also.",35,91,Chardonnay,US,US,1

11720,"Luscious, long, full-bodied and rich, a wonderful wine that showcases its appellation. Has well-ripened flavors of blackcurrants and cassis that drink long and deep, although there's some hollowness, which costs it a few points.

67413,"Aromas of barrel spice and grilled pineapple are solid, while the palate is thick and creamy with orange marmalade and banana flavors.

27869,"Sweet meets earthy, with aromas that recall grilled beets, cola and sassafras. The bottling comes from the father-son team of Tondré and Joe Alarid, who planted their vineyard in 1997 and combined have nearly a century's worth of farming experience in the Salinas Valley. Homemade cranberry sauce wins the palate, and the wine has more tannins than most Pinot Noirs of similar age. Enjoy now or cellar until 2016 for even more emerging flavors.",40,91,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
92451,"The nose is volatile and pruney, the color dark, almost Port-like. The wine is very soft and flat. The fruit seems waxy and dead, lightly pruney but also a bit green; it tastes as though half the grapes were underripe and half were raisined.",32,84,Merlot,US,US,1

85641,"A massive wine that could only have been grown under the California sun. Shows enormously ripe flavors of red and black currants, cola, red plums and spices, enriched with significant oak. Not particularly nuanced or elegant now due to the obvious power. Could age out, but the future is uncertain.",48,87,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
55978,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine's fruit is sourced entirely from the Conner Lee Vineyard.

It's tasty though varietally uncommon.",25,88,Sauvignon Blanc,US,US,1
44353,"A pear, apple-orange and earth bouquet sets the stage for a palate chockful of pineapple, pear and lemon flavor. Toast notes offset and vibrant acidity uplifts the fruit nicely.

13108,"With each bump up in price, the winemaker ups the percentage of new oak; here it's 25%. Half the fruit is estate grown, and this light, clean, well-balanced wine drinks like a village Burgundy, with the right hint of herb around the tart red fruit.",18,88,Pinot Noir,US,France,0

90401,"Very ripe and aromatic, throwing out cascades of inviting scents. New toasty oak dominates, with undercurrents of blackberry jam, blueberry, mocha and anise.

26031,"Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 7% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, from a vineyard just across the road from Champoux. Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato.",85,93,Red Blend,US,US,1
92620,"The Cabernet Sauvignon is from vines planted in 1972—fruit that once went into Leonetti Cab.

37331,"Some Cabs go into a dip at the age of five, and this may be one of them. It's a little awkward in structure, with a sharpness of feeling, and the oak isn't integrated with the ripe blackberry fruit. Could emerge and be fine in a couple more years.",42,86,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1

55349,"A meaty Shiraz that pulls no punches, proudly displaying its black raspberry and earthy, salumi-infused flavors around a rich, dense texture full of leather and a touch of smoke.

48600,"An interesting Chard that offers quite sweet notes of stewed peaches, orange marmalade and overripe honeydew.

102800,"This is what might be called old-style Washington Cabernet. The fruit is mixed liberally with bell pepper and dill; there is plenty of tannin and a distinctly earthy aroma of the barnyard that carries well into the finish.

28510,"An interesting wine you can call intellectual. Its appeal is as much conceptual as hedonistic. It's the opposite of today's soft, sweet fruit bombs, being bone dry and somewhat austere, showing a tightly knit tannic structure.

98166,"Aalto is one of several smaller projects being led by former Vega Sicilia head winemaker Mariano García, and we think this 2001 Pagos Seliccionados (PS) is his best effort to date. The wine is dark, with charcoal, lemon and pure black-fruit aromas. It features a brilliant luster and deep, rich, syrupy flavors of maple, boysenberry and black cherry. Shows a beautiful finish and amazing depth. Hold until 2006–07.",105,95,Tinto del Pais,Spain,Spain,1
91629,"With 6 Rhône varieties, including Viognier, this is a fresh, fruity wine meant to be consumed within the next five years. It's strong in cherry, blackberry and other berry flavors, with the smoky vanilla of oak.",40,87,Rhône-style Red Blend,US,France,0

59957,"A distinctive Syrah that shows great concentration in the focused blackberry, sweet leather, dark chocolate, mineral and black pepper flavors. Beyond the power, the wine is bone dry, soft in acidity and quite tannic. The end result is impressive, and ready to drink now.",28,90,Syrah,US,France,0
82710,"Spicy, toasty wine, the fruit tropically rich. The texture is dense, the acidity important but not dominant. Delicious wine, now maturing well.",27,91,Chardonnay,France,US,0
69577,"A five-grape Bordeaux blend, substantial and pretty. Sweet, slightly candied cherry and plum fruit opens the wine, which has some interesting layering, bringing in cassis, hints of herb and edgy tannins.",27,88,Red Blend,US,France,0
45739,"Nothing special about this blend of Tempranillo and Shiraz. In fact, it's more austere and less pleasing than the brand's basic 2007 Temp-Shiraz blend. That said, this wine shows thin raspberry flavors and a tangy, almost sour back end. Probably best with food; not real good on its own.",12,83,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Spain,Spain,1
34191,"This is a real New Zealand-style Sauvignon Blanc. It's dry and tart, with rich gooseberry, lime, green apple, Asian pear, vanilla and white pepper flavors. A touch of oak brings a pleasant, buttery toastiness. The grapes come from the cool Arroyo Seco AVA and the warm San Lucas AVA, a brilliant blending decision that makes this wine especially balanced.",16,89,Sauvignon Blanc,US,US,1
78680,"This tart and aromatic white blend could be labeled Chardonnay; less than a quarter is a mix of Riesling, Muscat, Gewürztraminer and Pinot Gris. It's detailed and lively, with bright citrus, pineapple, pink grapefruit and sweet spice.",13,88,White Blend,US,US,1
61062,"Here's a luminous and bright Chardonnay with a well-balanced aromatic offering that spans from toasted nut to chalky mineral to exotic fruit. Overall, the wine tastes smooth and creamy, but there are a few sharp points of acidity that help move it along the palate. It's a sophisticated white wine in a very elegant bottle.",38,90,Chardonnay,Italy,France,0

77073,"Slightly sweet on the nose, the aromas of baked fruit, cream soda and vanilla are welcoming. Interestingly, the wine is a bit more tart and refined on the palate, where zesty but full apple and pear flavors run the show. Not lean but definitely streamlined and acidic. More of a food wine than a stand-alone sipper.",14,88,Sparkling Blend,Spain,Italy,0
66650,"This is a small-production blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc made by a winemaker who knows a lot about Bordeaux blends, Genevieve Janssens, the longtime vintner at Robert Mondavi. It's ripe and pretty tannic, with cassis and smoky, 100% new oak flavors. An ambitious wine, it's quite good, and needs time in the cellar to soften and resolve. Best after 2008, at least.",125,92,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,US,1
5885,"Made from organically farmed grapes, this offers tropical and white stone fruit aromas. On the bright palate, a saline hint underscores yellow apple, Bartlett pear and citrus fruit. It finishes clean and crisp.",20,89,Grillo,Italy,Italy,1
103165,"Acorn, which does such interesting things with Rhône varieties, shows it's no slouch with Bordeaux varieties, to judge from this fresh, succulent young red wine.

88749,"Here's a wine that holds its own in a ranking of top Nebbiolos. There's depth and great promise of fruit here, which is wrapped within folds of vanilla, ginger, cinnamon and dusty mineral. The mouthfeel is plush and velvety and the wine ends with tart but succulent tannins. It will drink beautifully for five-plus years.",40,93,Nebbiolo,Italy,Italy,1
98789,"This makes you wonder why it took so long for California vintners to understand that Chard doesn't have to be drenched in oak to be succulent. The wine is crisp and dry in pineapple, pink grapefruit, green apple and cinnamon spice flavors. Great with shellfish and grilled chicken.",20,87,Chardonnay,US,US,1
61147,"Quite a beautiful Cabernet, showing Oakville character of black currants and cedar and profoundly fine tannins, as well as a great depth of flavor and ageworthiness. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's lush and dramatic now, and should easily develop over the next 6–10 years.",55,94,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
88215,"Here is a plush and elegant Barbera d'Alba with bright fruit tones followed by graphite, a dash of exotic spice and pretty earthy nuances. The wine is bright and fruity in the mouth with cherry and blackberry on the close.",20,87,Barbera,Italy,Italy,1
49129,"Wild Horse captures the essence of Central Coast Pinot. The wine isn't especially complex or ageable, but defines the fruit and acid balance of the region. Cherries, black raspberries, root beer and spiced rum punch are the flavors, and the wine is silky and dry.",25,87,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
70653,"Unique and appealing, with scents of pear drop and roasted walnuts leading into a luxuriously textured palate. Caramel notes from toasty new oak vie with kiwi flavors in the mouth while the finish is long and dry. Drink now or age a few years for even more complexity.",22,89,Chardonnay,Italy,US,0

13480,"Already past its prime, this Garnacha-based rosado has sweet nectarine aromas along with a sugary, creamy palate. If it had more zest upon release, that's mostly gone at this stage. Wait for the 2006.",7,82,Garnacha,Spain,Spain,1
73910,"Very pure—this has a straight line of acidity right to the wine's citrus- and pineapple-flavored heart. It is structured and taut, with its acidity dominant. It is concentrated and ready to age for 2–3 years.",25,91,Sauvignon Blanc,France,France,1
30223,"Aromas suggest apricot, lemon drop, exotic fruit and subtle oak. The forward palate delivers yellow peach, nectarine, green melon and lemon drop alongside a note of vanilla.",49,89,Sauvignon,Italy,US,0

35054,"Cherry and vanilla are this ripasso's most prominent aromas but if you dig deep you will uncover Spanish cedar, blueberry tart, maple syrup and Indian spice.

32186,"Full-bodied and dry. You can taste the Pinot Noir in the black and red cherry and red currant flavors. A bit rough in texture, but pretty good for the price. Will pair well with roast salmon or even a lamb chop.",22,87,Sparkling Blend,US,France,0
8356,"The nose is heady and fragrant, edged with dried chamomile and hay flowers and subdued honey. Underneath that is a notion of sweet, luscious apricot compote. With time, there are the most subtle notes of enticing pine resin and fir honey—lit and illuminated all the way by the purest and most concentrated of lemon acidity. A triumph of balance and richness.",90,95,Pinot Gris,France,France,1

27047,"It's a fine wine, full-bodied and dry, with spicy flavors of currants, teriyaki beef, black pepper and cola, with a bracing minerality that grounds the richness. Could be more concentrated, but it's a great value.",12,87,Syrah,US,US,1
8805,"Fruity, crisp with red-currant and citrus flavors, this is a bright, vivacious wine. There is a tight mineral edge that contrasts with the fruitiness and turns this into a food friendly wine. Drink now.",25,88,Rosé,France,France,1

52697,"Showing lots more depth and focus than Husch's regular Pinot Noir, this wine comes from nearly 40-year-old grapes grown on the estate. It's charming, light and silky in the mouth, with brilliant acidity framing intense flavors of cherries and spices. Should age well for up to a decade.",40,92,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
91278,"A richly soft, creamy wine, dominated by flavors of white currants and chives, this is full-bodied and still young. There is enough ripe acidity and full-flavored fruit to see it develop well over five years.",50,90,Chardonnay,France,France,1
68420,"There's a tight, tannic coarseness to this Petite Sirah that makes it a little bitter and difficult. On the other hand, it's elegantly structured, with a rich core of blackberries. This suggests ageability, it could improve in the bottle.",24,87,Petite Sirah,US,US,1
11293,"Big, rich and fruity, with fantastically ripe cherry and Dr. Pepper flavors that are elevated by a note of sweet sandalwood, and brightened with crisp acidity. Impresses for sheer power, as well as the long, spicy finish. This is too young to drink now; it needs 5–6 years to mellow.",49,90,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
49388,"A rustic wine, with definite barnyard flavors. The fruit has some smoky extract, but the tannins and old wood tastes intrude too much.",19,92,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,France,1
55434,"Heavy on the oak, with overpowering buttered toast and butterscotch flavors. Underneath all that are pineapple and peach flavors. The finish is sweet and heavy.",27,84,Chardonnay,US,US,1
44314,"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture. The cherry, cola, red licorice and bacon flavors are satisfyingly rich, with elaborate oak overtones. It's a pretty good value in an under-$20 Pinot Noir.",18,86,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
43080,"You'll notice a unique and terroir-driven note of freshly milled white peppercorn that distinguishes this Amarone. In the background are generous tones of berry, black mineral and toasted almond. Pair this extraordinary wine with roasted meat or aged cheese.",118,94,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Italy,Italy,1
41102,"A ripe and rich Barbera d'Asti Superiore with pleasantly inviting aromas of ripe blackberry, Maraschino cherry and exotic spice. All those aromatic layers are washed clean over the palate thanks to the wine's fresh acidity that kicks in on the finish.",16,88,Barbera,Italy,Italy,1

11096,"Pinots from this vineyard, which is between the Anderson and Alexander valleys, always seem earthy and tannic in youth, and so it is with this bottling. With oak-inspired cherry, cola, tobacco and spice flavors, it could develop bottle complexity in 4–6 years.",42,87,Pinot Noir,US,US,1
74076,"The problem with this wine is the wood. There is too much of it, and the toasting is too high, giving a burnt character to the wine. For a 2005, this should be better integrated, and is likely to just dry out.",29,80,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,France,1
78777,"An oaky, hearty wine that in many ways wants to be Chardonnay. The nose exudes fresh-cut wood, while the flavor profile is all about buttered toast, apple and peach. Stylistically, it's California all the way, yet there's enough acid and natural flavor to help it from being too heavy.",28,89,Sauvignon Blanc,US,US,1

77998,"Stimulatingly fresh and clean, this polished SB benefits from crisp acidity provoked by its cool growing region. The flavors are of figs, citrus fruits and nectarines, but they could be a bit more focused.",15,85,Sauvignon Blanc,US,France,0
59153,"Marion makes some of the best Amarone on sale today and this standout expression from the stellar 2004 vintage proves the point. The wine is thick, deliciously succulent and redolent of mature black fruit, spice, leather, chocolate and pipe tobacco.",70,93,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Italy,Italy,1
92656,"An unusual blend of 80% Clairette and 20% Bourboulenc, this medium-bodied wine is crisp and citrusy, marked by pineapple and hints of underripe peach and pear. It's light enough to be paired with more delicate seafood dishes over the summer months.",11,86,Rhône-style White Blend,France,France,1
39951,"Thick, ripe, creamy and luscious, this 15.4% Sémillon carries itself with grace and style. The dense fruit flavors mix peaches, apricots, pears and spicy apples; with a hint of caramel and brown sugar. Though quite dry, it has so much fruit as to seem lightly sweet, and the high alcohol does not take away from the complexity. If it were not fermented dry, this would be a stunning late harvest dessert wine.",19,90,Sémillon,US,France,0
52319,"This vintage marks a big step forward for this Oregon Sauvignon Blanc. As fresh and racy as a bright young Quincy from the Loire, this sappy Sauvignon has the snap of natural acidity and a tongue-tingling mix of melon, lime and grapefruit on the palate. It's drinking beautifully right now while at its most fresh.",20,90,Sauvignon Blanc,US,US,1

103618,"Apple-cider and earth aromas open to a simple apple-toast palate. The mouthfeel is even, the finish dry and rather woody. Then again, there are few drinkable California Chardonnays of this age.",13,82,Chardonnay,US,US,1
44960,"Another spectacular effort, though they've bumped up the price significantly. This is beautifully varietal, mixing floral, bath powder, apple and grapefruit components in both the nose and the mouth. There is an elegant intensity that powers the wine through an exceptionally long, brilliant finish; the residual sweetness keeps the alcohol down to 11.5% without making the wine either soft or sugary. 14,500 cases produced.",8,90,Gewürztraminer,US,France,0
6184,"Fans of Petit Verdot, which has almost attained cult status in Washington, will not want to miss this spectacular effort. Bright, chewy and muscular though it is, the tannins have been polished perfectly, and set off with 40% new oak, adding dark, smoky chocolate and espresso flavors. The acidity keeps up, underscoring tart berry fruit with some sweet green-tomato highlights.",30,94,Petit Verdot,US,US,1
83408,"A curious wine. It's not tasting at all good now. So tannic, so new oaky, it feels clumsy and astringent and awkward in the mouth. Then you realize how rich the heart of fruit is, offering an enormous array of blackberries, blueberries and black currants. The grapes are from Rutherford. The gamble is if the fruit will outlast the tannins.",80,91,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
33392,"An extraordinary wine, dry, crisp in acidity and wonderfully silky in the mouth. The flavors are deep and complex, changing with every second as the wine breathes. Raspberries, wild clove and cinnamon spices, cola, dried herbs, things that taste earthy and minerally and woodsy. Insanely complex and dynamic, this Pinot should age for up to eight years.",65,95,Pinot Noir,US,France,0
101408,"From the Côte de Rouffach area, this is a wine that's eminently alive. Apricot, nectarine and mango comprise the all-fruit nose and palate. All in all, it's like a peachy parfait. If you dig deep you'll find some of those custard, stone and petrol nuances that give Alsace Rieslings their character.",19,88,Riesling,France,France,1
16604,"A useful Zin, rich and sweet and savory. Blended for complexity with Syrah and Petite Sirah, it's satisfying in black cherry, red licorice and cola flavors, sprinkled with black pepper and baking spices. Easy to drink with barbecue, burgers and such.",12,87,Zinfandel,US,US,1

27811,"Pretty dark in color and full bodied for a sparkling wine, even one that's majority Pinot Noir. But it's delicious and dry, which surely are prime requisites for any bubbly. Shows ripe, flashy raspberry, strawberry, orange, vanilla, honey, yeast and toast flavors, and the mouthfeel is silky and refined.",28,90,Sparkling Blend,US,France,0
76937,"I drank this at the end of a long, hot summer day, which is when a cold, crisp white is at its best. What a delicious wine. Bold citrus and apricot flavors, acids so strong they almost fizz and a rich creaminess even though there's no oak.",19,89,Sauvignon Blanc,US,France,0
90044,"Smells and tastes porty, but dry, with raisiny-chocolaty flavors of blackberries and currants. Drink now.",22,83,Malbec,US,Spain,0
33523,"Young and fresh, it has excellent minerality. The fruit is light and lively, leaning toward grapefruit, green apple and a smidge of just-ripe melon. It's a lovely summer sipper, with a few good years of life ahead.",16,87,Pinot Gris,US,Italy,0

64718,"Quite green and also raisiny, which doesn't really compute seeing that one indicates underripeness and the other overripeness. But throw both together and you get a wine that's not all that pleasing and seems to be striving for equilibrium. Gummy, green and thick-tasting in the mouth. A hard wine to get excited about.",18,82,Red Blend,Spain,US,0
72011,"Mountain fruit is the key to understanding this 100% Cab. By that is meant a unique combination of firm, astringent tannins and fabulously concentrated blackberry and currant fruit that absolutely demands aging. It's obvious that the terroir these grapes come from needs an appellation other than Alexander Valley, for there's nothing soft or herbal going on here. Hold until 2010, then should develop through 2014, at least.",85,93,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,US,1
67222,"Hats off to the Zonin family for being among the first to offer a Viognier from southern Tuscany.

There's a dusty touch of mineral or brimstone on the finish.",15,88,Viognier,Italy,Italy,1
31482,"A beautifully drinkable Merlot. It's softly tannic and quite dry, with a polish of smoky oak that frames deep, ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and exotic spices. Very nice now and for the next 3–4 years.",24,91,Merlot,US,US,1
